All roads other than National Highways in the States fall within the jurisdiction of respective State Governments. However, the Ministry allocates fund for development of State Roads under Central Road Infrastructure Fund (CRIF) scheme.\nThe Ministry is also responsible for evolving standards and specifications for roads and bridges in the country besides acting as a repository of technical information on roads and bridges.\n\n3.2 **Vision 2047**\nMoRTH has defined a Vision 2047 for the National Highways sector which serves as the guiding principle for the Master Plan of National Highways and allied infrastructure. Vision 2047 for the National Highways aims to provide equity, efficiency and strategic connectivity to meet 5 key objectives:\n1. Access to high-speed corridor within 100-150 km to all citizens\n2. India to rank amongst top 10 countries in G20 for high-speed corridor density\n3. Equitable access to National Highways in under-developed regions\n4. Improve passenger convenience with world class Passenger Amenities\n5. Reduction in logistics cost as a share of GDP\nThe Master Plan for the National Highways is being developed in line with the aforementioned vision.\n\n3.3 The length of National Highways is 1,46,195 km.

All roads other than National Highways in the States fall within the jurisdiction of respective State Governments. However, the Ministry allocates fund for development of State Roads under Central Road Infrastructure Fund (CRIF) scheme.\nThe Ministry is also responsible for evolving standards and specifications for roads and bridges in the country besides acting as a repository of technical information on roads and bridges.\n\n3.2 **Vision 2047**\nMoRTH has defined a Vision 2047 for the National Highways sector which serves as the guiding principle for the Master Plan of National Highways and allied infrastructure. Vision 2047 for the National Highways aims to provide equity, efficiency and strategic connectivity to meet 5 key objectives:\n1. Access to high-speed corridor within 100-150 km to all citizens\n2. India to rank amongst top 10 countries in G20 for high-speed corridor density\n3. Equitable access to National Highways in under-developed regions\n4. Improve passenger convenience with world class Passenger Amenities\n5. Reduction in logistics cost as a share of GDP\nThe Master Plan for the National Highways is being developed in line with the aforementioned vision.\n\n3.3 The length of National Highways is 1,46,195 km.

There are 227 Ports (13 Major, 214 Non-Major) along the coastline of which 78 ports are operational (12 Major, 66 Non-Major), 11 ports (1 Major, 10 Non-Major) are under implementation and other 138 ports are currently non-operational. Out of 89 operational/under-implementation ports, 64 have sufficient connectivity. MoRTH has planned the development of 108 PCR projects of length 3,700 km.\n\nTo ensure adequate last-mile connectivity to all the operational/under implementation ports in the country, a comprehensive Port Connectivity Masterplan was developed by MoRTH in consultation with Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways (MoPSW) and Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT). As part of the Masterplan, connectivity requirements of all the operational and under implementation ports were assessed and connectivity projects were identified. 59 additional critical infrastructure projects of length ~1,300 km was finally selected for implementation.\n\nThese projects will help in improving last-mile required road connectivity to all the operational/under-implementation ports in India providing a boost to economic activities via seamless movement of goods. Post completion of all the Port Connectivity Projects, all the 89 operational and under-implementation ports in the country shall have sufficient connectivity. Currently 10 projects having about 313 km length have been completed, 26 projects having about 1,754 km length are under implementation and Bidding process/DPR is in progress for remaining 72 projects (1,631 km).\n\n4.3 Wayside Amenities (WSA)\n\nTo improve the comfort and convenience of the Highway users, the Ministry has planned the development of state-of-the-art Wayside Amenities (WSA) at about every 40-60 kms along the National Highways on PPP mode. These facilities are aimed to provide multiple options of rest and refreshment for the highway commuters during their journey.

There are 227 Ports (13 Major, 214 Non-Major) along the coastline of which 78 ports are operational (12 Major, 66 Non-Major), 11 ports (1 Major, 10 Non-Major) are under implementation and other 138 ports are currently non-operational. Out of 89 operational/under-implementation ports, 64 have sufficient connectivity. MoRTH has planned the development of 108 PCR projects of length 3,700 km.\n\nTo ensure adequate last-mile connectivity to all the operational/under implementation ports in the country, a comprehensive Port Connectivity Masterplan was developed by MoRTH in consultation with Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways (MoPSW) and Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT). As part of the Masterplan, connectivity requirements of all the operational and under implementation ports were assessed and connectivity projects were identified. 59 additional critical infrastructure projects of length ~1,300 km was finally selected for implementation.\n\nThese projects will help in improving last-mile required road connectivity to all the operational/under-implementation ports in India providing a boost to economic activities via seamless movement of goods. Post completion of all the Port Connectivity Projects, all the 89 operational and under-implementation ports in the country shall have sufficient connectivity.

Further, it will provide more opportunity to three wheeled auto rickshaw owners to utilize the two-wheeler for commercial purposes namely viz. taxi aggregator, home delivery services, e-commerce, etc. It will also enable existing three-wheeler owners to own a two-wheeler for their commercial as well as personal use while allowing them flexibility to optimize the benefits.\n\n#### 6.5.2 Retrofitment in BS VI\nMinistry vide GSR 407(E) dated the 15<sup>th</sup> July, 2024 has amended rule 115C of CMVR, 1989 to prescribe that the type approval for vehicles retrofitted with LPG kits shall be valid for six years from the date of issue of such approval and shall be renewed for every six years at a time.\n\n#### 6.5.3 Revision of Standards for Safety Belt, Restraint Systems and Safety Belt Reminder\nMinistry vide GSR 514(E), dated the 14<sup>th</sup> August, 2024 has amended the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 to provide provisions for applicability of revised standards for safety belt assemblies, safety belt anchorages and the installation of Safety Belts and Restraint Systems in Motor vehicles of category M, N and L7 w.e.f. 1<sup>st</sup> April, 2025. Further, the vehicles of category M1 manufactured on and after the 1<sup>st</sup> April, 2025, shall meet the requirement of safety belt reminder for all front facing rear seats as per AIS-145-2018.\n\n#### 6.5.4 Safety Requirements for Electric Power Train Construction Equipment Vehicles\nMoRTH vide G.S.R. 721(E) inserted rule 125-O in Central Motor Vehicles Rules (CMVR), 1989 regarding Safety Requirements for Electric Power Train Construction Equipment Vehicles and mandated that on and after 1<sup>st</sup> January, 2025, Construction Equipment Vehicles fitted with Electric Power Train shall meet requirements as specified in AIS-174, till the corresponding BIS specifications are notified under the Bureau of Indian Standard Act, 2016 (11 of 2016).\n\nसड़क पर लगा यह चिन्ह दर्शाता है कि कितनी लंबाई का वाहन उस रास्ते से गुजर सकता है। यह चिन्ह तीव्र मोड़ या घुमावदार मोड़ पर लगाया जाता है। यह उन लंबे और बड़े आकार के वाहनों के लिए होता है जो सुरक्षित ढंग से मुड़ नहीं सकते।\nThis sign on road indicates that length of the vehicle, which can be manoeuvred through that passage.

It is clear from the report that road accidents are multi-causal which requires multi-pronged measures to mitigate the problems through concerted efforts of all agencies both in the Central and State Governments. Road Accident measures which are within the purview of the MoRTH include road engineering design for safety; proper road marking and signages; safety standards for vehicles like use of seat belts etc., education and awareness campaign and programmes. The Ministry has formulated a multi-pronged strategy to address the issue of road safety based on Education, Engineering (both of roads and vehicles), Enforcement and Emergency Care."
