The document reaffirms the basic human right’s character of education with its implications on beneficiaries as well as duty bearers. Furthermore, this strategic framework represents a significant step towards enhancing education across the continent, promoting quality and inclusive learning opportunities for all.\nSeveral areas have been emphasized more in this strategy than was the case in the previous CESA. As a few examples, the strategy places a stronger emphasis on the acquisition of skills by learners – from foundational skills to socio-emotional and labor market ready skills. It reaffirms the central role of teachers in improving educational outcomes and identifies school leadership as an important area for investments. It emphasizes education as a life-long process, noting the importance of second chance programs for children and youth who dropped out of school as well as programs for adult literacy. And it notes the essential role of education in dealing with broad challenges, including those related to digitalization and artificial intelligence, greening education, and education in emergencies and the need to prevent conflicts.\nThis comprehensive strategy marks a pivotal advancement in promoting quality education across the continent, addressing the diverse needs of our populations and fostering sustainable development. The strategy embodies a shared responsibility to transform Africa’s education systems into vehicles for equity, innovation, and sustainable development. This achievement is a result of collective efforts, dialogue, and a shared vision. We commend the collaborative efforts of Member States, Regional Economic Communities (RECs), national, regional, and international education experts, development partners, teachers, educators, researchers, youth and civil society organizations including teacher unions, technical and advisory committees, African Union Departments and Agencies, partners in academia and the private sector, and African Union leadership and visionaries. I also want to express our heartfelt appreciation to UNESCO IICBA for its pivotal role in the development of this strategy.

As declared by Heads of State during the African Union (AU) side event for the Transforming Education Summit (TES) held in New York in September 2022, \"Education remains a basic human right as outlined in article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 28 of the Convention on the rights of the child and article 11 of the African charter on the rights and welfare of the child, all of which emphasising the need for State parties to provide free and compulsory basic education<sup>1</sup>.\" The Continental Education Strategy for Africa 2026-35 (CESA 26-35) aims to contribute to the realization of this right for all children, youth, and adults in Africa.\nEducation remains a top priority for Africa. CESA 26-35 expands and updates for the next decade the previous CESA 16-25. Agenda 2063<sup>2</sup> envisions a \"peaceful and prosperous Africa, integrated, led by its own citizens and occupying the place it deserves in the global community and in the knowledge economy.\" A decade ago, the AU's vision for education was laid out in CESA 16-25, expanding on global targets enshrined in the United Nations' Strategic Development Goal 4 (SDG 4)<sup>3</sup>. A review of CESA 16-25 suggests that it had a positive impact, with lessons learned on how to increase this impact further<sup>4</sup>. Education remains a priority today, as noted in the second action plan<sup>5</sup> for Agenda 2063. This strategy incorporates findings from CESA 16-25 review<sup>6</sup> to provide a new framework for action for 2026-35.\nThe preparation of CESA 26-35 took place from May to September 2024. The process was launched with a consultation at the 11<sup>th</sup> Annual Conference of the Africa Federation of Teaching Regulatory Authorities. A second consultation was held at the AU's 1<sup>st</sup> Pan-African Conference on Girls' and Women's Education. The process was also discussed at other events, including the 2<sup>nd</sup> Interregional Dialogue on Education and Development in Latin America, the Caribbean, and Africa, the East and Southern Africa sub-regional consultation for the Global Education Meeting, and the China-Africa Deans of Education Forum. It is estimated that over 2,500 people participated in these and other events. Two meetings were held with members of the CESA taskforce (Annex) to benefit from comments on the outline for the review and new strategy. A third Technical Consultation Meeting was attended by over 130 participants. A dozen online surveys were launched to gather feedback with over 1,700 respondents providing feedback. Key documents from the AU and other organizations were reviewed to ensure alignment. As next step, the draft CESA 26-35 will be submitted to the AU's Specialized Technical Committee on Education, after which the new strategy (revised as needed) could be approved at the AU Summit of February 2025. The research conducted for the strategy relied on a variety of data sources, including: (i) Relevant documents at the continental, regional, and country level, with a focus on documents from the AU; (ii) The academic and grey literature; (iii) Primary data collection through a dozen online surveys with stakeholders; and (iv) Inputs from discussions with a range of individuals from target groups and AUC staff and leadership.\nThe strategy is comprised of four parts: (1) A brief investment case; (2) A review of selected challenges; (3) A framework for action; and (4) A discussion on governance, communications, and monitoring. Part I for the investment case considers (i) Human rights, peace and sustainable development, including considerations related to gender, equity, and inclusion; (ii) Health and social benefits; and (iii) Labor market benefits. Part II reviews progress (or the lack thereof) for schooling and learning, as well as the links between both. It also provides a summary of key findings from the CESA 16-25 review. Part III is the core of the strategy. It provides a framework for action with six strategic areas of focus and 20 objectives. Part IV is about governance, communications, and data for monitoring and evaluation (M&E).\nPart I makes it clear that investing in education is one of the best investment countries can make. Education is a fundamental human right and crucial for communities and societies to promote peace and sustainable development<sup>7</sup>. In addition, a wealth of data demonstrates the benefits from education. In Africa and globally, human development outcomes, including earnings but also a range of other outcomes related to health and social protection, are driven in large part by education, accounts for about two thirds of the changing wealth of nations, a much larger share than natural or produced capital. The human capital index, another measure, is heavily influenced by educational outcomes based on evidence of high rates of returns to education in labor markets. Apart from higher earnings, education is associated with many other benefits. Additional years of education lead to reduced risks of adult mortality.

It is estimated that over 2,500 people participated in these and other events. Two meetings were held with members of the CESA taskforce (Annex) to benefit from comments on the outline for the review and new strategy. A third Technical Consultation Meeting was attended by over 130 participants. A dozen online surveys were launched to gather feedback with over 1,700 respondents providing feedback. Key documents from the AU and other organizations were reviewed to ensure alignment. As next step, the draft CESA 26-35 will be submitted to the AU's Specialized Technical Committee on Education, after which the new strategy (revised as needed) could be approved at the AU Summit of February 2025. The research conducted for the strategy relied on a variety of data sources, including: (i) Relevant documents at the continental, regional, and country level, with a focus on documents from the AU; (ii) The academic and grey literature; (iii) Primary data collection through a dozen online surveys with stakeholders; and (iv) Inputs from discussions with a range of individuals from target groups and AUC staff and leadership.\n\nThe strategy is comprised of four parts: (1) A brief investment case; (2) A review of selected challenges; (3) A framework for action; and (4) A discussion on governance, communications, and monitoring. Part I for the investment case considers (i) Human rights, peace and sustainable development, including considerations related to gender, equity, and inclusion; (ii) Health and social benefits; and (iii) Labor market benefits. Part II reviews progress (or the lack thereof) for schooling and learning, as well as the links between both. It also provides a summary of key findings from the CESA 16-25 review. Part III is the core of the strategy. It provides a framework for action with six strategic areas of focus and 20 objectives. Part IV is about governance, communications, and data for monitoring and evaluation (M\\&E).\n\nPart I makes it clear that investing in education is one of the best investment countries can make. Education is a fundamental human right and crucial for communities and societies to promote peace and sustainable development<sup>7</sup>. In addition, a wealth of data demonstrates the benefits from education. In Africa and globally, human development outcomes, including earnings but also a range of other outcomes related to health and social protection, are driven in large part by education, accounts for about two thirds of the changing wealth of nations, a much larger share than natural or produced capital. The human capital index, another measure, is heavily influenced by educational outcomes based on evidence of high rates of returns to education in labor markets. Apart from higher earnings, education is associated with many other benefits. Additional years of education lead to reduced risks of adult mortality.

Their children are less likely to die by age five or be stunted. Better educated women also have lower total fertility rates, which can help usher a demographic dividend. The analysis shows how education matters for Africa’s development, and how according to the metrics used, much more needs to be done to improve educational outcomes.\nPart II notes that challenges remain massive. Improving educational outcomes is not easy anywhere, but it is especially hard in Africa. The challenges are massive given low levels of enrollment and completion and insufficient learning when children and youth are in school. Initial conditions, including the limited qualifications of teachers, their (often) low levels of pay, and their high level of stress, are not conducive to great teaching. The fact that many parents are illiterate and may not be able to support their children’s learning at home is also an issue. Climate shocks and conflicts also contribute to poor educational outcomes. Compounding these constraints is another major limitation: because such a large share of the population is in age of schooling (whether for basic, TVET, or higher education), and because the cost of providing education is often higher as a share of GDP than is in other countries, countries have difficulties in financing their education systems adequately. This is especially the case today given high levels of debt. Essentially, a lack of investment in education commensurate with population growth and the need to improve quality has resulted in significant gaps in provision for children, young people, and adults. One good news, however, is that the CESA 16-25 review suggests that a new CESA 26-35 could help since CESA 16-25 was thought to be useful by many stakeholders, including Ministries.\nPart III provides a framework for action for CESA 26-35 with six strategic areas (SAs) and 20 objectives, including one for implementation and another for monitoring and evaluation. The six SAs are:\nSA1: Resources and enabling environment. This broad SA covers issues from pre-primary to higher education related to funding, governance, infrastructure, curriculum and learning resources, and sector-wide policy, including recognition of the fact that different service providers (public, private, faith-based, others) contribute in important ways to education systems.\nSA2: Teachers, educators, and caregivers. This SA covers issues pertaining to the recruitment, career progression, and professional development of teachers, educators or instructors (e.g., for TVET), and caregivers (e.g., for children under 3 years old) as well as their well-being. This relates to salaries and benefits, but also to leadership and accountability, and to teachers’ mental health and motivation.\nSA3: Pre-primary to secondary education, with a focus on early learning and foundational, socio-emotional, and 21st century and labor market skills. This SA focuses on outcomes for learners, recognizing the different types of skills that they need to acquire, as well as the fact that schools should promote health and well-being among students as well as 21st century skills, including for the labor market. The issues matter most for pre-primary to secondary education even if they remain relevant at higher levels.\nSA4: Higher Education and TVET. This SA covers post-secondary education where specific challenges must be met, including links between education, innovation, and economic development.\nSA5: Second chance programs and lifelong learning. This SA covers issues related to second chance programs for children and youth out-of-school, including to promote re-entry into school, and the need to provide lifelong learning opportunities for all.\nSA6: Gender, equity, and inclusion. This key SA emphasizes the need for education systems to serve the entire population, with special attention to be given to gender, equity, and inclusion.\nCross-cutting themes: Several themes or mega-trends are cross-cutting and need attention, including (i) digitalization and AI; (ii) greening education; and (iii) education in emergencies.\nA simple visual aims to facilitate communications around the SAs.

The cluster mechanism is a useful way to federate AU education partners by areas of focus and expertise. Clusters mostly function today as a way of sharing information and organizing events, but they could play a larger role. For example, the guidance provided in the strategy is based on the context of Africa and the evidence available at the time of writing. This context and the evidence can change, especially over a decade. One of the roles of clusters should be to keep CESA guidance updated and deepen guidance in their thematic area as more knowledge becomes available. Beyond serving as a mechanism for information exchange, clusters should support the generation of new evidence and the mobilization of stakeholders. They need autonomy in their work, but should also be held accountable, including in terms of the roles played by cluster leaders. When clusters are not fulfilling their role or become inactive, steps should be undertaken to engage the leadership and possibly replace leaders. Finding ways to support clusters in resource mobilization matters too, as this is a constraint to effectiveness. Ensuring more collaboration between clusters should also be a priority to reap benefits from synergies (given new strategic areas and objectives in this strategy, and taking into account the performance of existing clusters, a remapping of CESA clusters in line with strategic areas and objectives should be considered).\nBeyond CESA 26-35, additional guidance should be generated through other documents, as is already the case in some areas. A good practice in strategies is to not have too many areas of focus, so that there is prioritization. For monitoring, a limited number of objectives is beneficial too. But there is an additional reason for keeping the number of SAs and objectives relatively small: the AU has adopted or is in the process of adopting other strategies and instruments relevant to education. For TVET for example, more detailed recommendations are provided in the TVET strategy prepared separately. The same is true for the recently adopted AU strategy on Education for Health and Well-being (EHW). CESA 26-35 should provide an overarching vision but leave more detailed guidance to other strategies or instruments. As visualized in the case of teachers in Figure ES3, while CESA outlines high-level objectives, more detailed guidance is available in sub-strategies such as the AU strategy on mental health and psycho-social support (MHPSS) for teachers being developed, or instruments like the African Continental Framework of Standards and Competencies for the Teaching Profession, the African Continental Teacher Qualification Framework, and the African Continental Teacher Mobility Protocol. Said differently, it should be acknowledged that not everything that matters for improving educational outcomes can be captured by the SAs and objectives of CESA 26-35, but the framework hopefully ensures focus in the guidance provided, so that other documents can go more in depth in issues that pertain to various sub-sectors or issues.\nFigure ES1: Framework for Action for CESA 26-35\ngraph TD\n    A[Agenda 2063] --- B[Common African Position]\n    A --- C[STISA]\n    A --- D[CESA]\n    A --- E[Digital]\n    A --- F[AI]\n    A --- G[YES]\n    A --- H[Others]\n    \n    D --- I[Teachers]\n    D --- J[TVET]\n    D --- K[EHW]\n    D --- L[Others]\n    \n    I --- M[Standards]\n    I --- N[ACTQF]\n    I --- O[Mobility]\n    I --- P[MHPSS]\n    I --- Q[Others]\nSource: Prepared for this report.\nNote: See the list of acronyms for abbreviations.\nMarch 2025 | CONTINENTAL EDUCATION STRATEGY FOR AFRICA 2026-2035: A Framework for Action | 15",

          "md": "CESA clusters, which proved to be useful as an implementation mechanism, should be strengthened. The cluster mechanism is a useful way to federate AU education partners by areas of focus and expertise. Clusters mostly function today as a way of sharing information and organizing events, but they could play a larger role. For example, the guidance provided in the strategy is based on the context of Africa and the evidence available at the time of writing. This context and the evidence can change, especially over a decade. One of the roles of clusters should be to keep CESA guidance updated and deepen guidance in their thematic area as more knowledge becomes available. Beyond serving as a mechanism for information exchange, clusters should support the generation of new evidence and the mobilization of stakeholders. They need autonomy in their work, but should also be held accountable, including in terms of the roles played by cluster leaders.

Improving educational outcomes in Africa is more important than ever. Learning from the experience of CESA 16-25, the AU is well positioned to provide guidance to Member States, RECs, and other education stakeholders on how to meet the challenges of the next decade. This strategy focuses on smaller number of objectives and puts a strong emphasis on the skills that learners need to acquire – including foundational, socio-emotional, and 21<sup>st</sup> century skills. The strategy outlines frameworks and interventions that build on the rapidly growing evidence base that can be used to inform policy. Through CESA 26-35, the AU aims to provide practical guidance to Member States, RECs, and other education stakeholders towards priority actions for the next decade, acknowledging that this guidance will need to be adapted to their own particular contexts.\nAs noted in the CESA 16-25 Review, education systems are not sailboats: they cannot change direction easily. They are like tankers. To change direction, beyond strategic vision, careful planning will be needed. Education systems in Africa and globally face headwinds. Funding and other resources are limited. Challenges abound, not only within education systems but also externally with conflicts and climate change being just two examples of external threats. Implications of the fourth industrial revolution for education systems, including the roles to be played by digitalization and AI, are only starting to be understood. Investing in education is one of the best investments countries can make, but to steer a tanker through challenging waters, beyond strategic vision implementation is key. Two points will require special attention. First, as already mentioned, the guidance given in this strategy will need to be adapted over time and across space considering the diversity of Member States the AU serves and their changing needs. Second, implementation will take place in a context in which many African (and non-African) countries face high levels of debt and constrained budgets. Assessing both needs and the cost-effectiveness of alternative interventions to meet these needs based on national and local contexts will be essential to maximize the benefits from investments in education. To transform their education systems, Member States and stakeholders including RECs will need to do more and better with limited resources. This will require prioritization. In the end, this strategy will be useful to the extent that its guidance helps inform domestic policy in Member States, including through Education Sector Planning and Compact Development. For CESA 26-35 to fulfill this role, resource mobilization and adequate implementation will be essential.\nMarch 2025 CONTINENTAL EDUCATION STRATEGY FOR AFRICA 2026-2035: A Framework for Action 17",

As declared by Heads of State during the African Union (AU) side event for the Transforming Education Summit (TES) held in New York in September 2022, \"Education remains a basic human right as outlined in article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 28 of the Convention on the rights of the child and article 11 of the African charter on the rights and welfare of the child, all of which emphasizing the need for State parties to provide free and compulsory basic education<sup>8</sup>.\" The Continental Education Strategy for Africa 2026-35 (CESA 26-35) aims to contribute to the realization of this right for all children, youth, and adults in Africa.\nEducation remains a top priority for Africa. The Continental Education Strategy for Africa for 2026-35 (CESA 26-35) expands and updates the previous strategy (CESA 16-25) for the next decade. Agenda 2063<sup>9</sup> envisions a \"peaceful and prosperous Africa, integrated, led by its own citizens and occupying the place it deserves in the global community and in the knowledge economy.\" Almost ten years ago, the AU's vision for education laid out in CESA 16-25, expanding on global targets enshrined in the United Nations' Strategic Development Goal 4 (SDG 4)<sup>10</sup>. A review of CESA 16-25 suggests that it had a positive impact, with lessons learned on how to increase this impact further<sup>11</sup>. As education remains a priority today, this strategy incorporates findings from the CESA 16-25 review<sup>12</sup> to provide a new framework for action for 2026-35, a period which overlaps with the Second Ten-Year Implementation Plan (2024-2033) of Agenda 2063<sup>13</sup>. The plan outlines seven ambitions: Every AU member state attains at least middle-income status; Africa is more integrated and connected; public institutions are more responsive; Africa resolves conflicts amicably; African cultures and values are explicit and promoted; African citizens are more empowered and productive; and Africa is a strong and influential global player. Education contributes to all seven.\nChallenges faced by education systems in Africa are unique, but so are opportunities. Progress was achieved under CESA, but in a limited way. The combination of current challenges, initial conditions, and limited funding make it hard to improve educational outcomes in Africa. The period was marked by major crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic and associated school closures with large negative effects on learners<sup>14</sup>. But there is also good news. CESA 16-25 covered a period during which many innovations were implemented at the country, regional, and continental level as well as globally. We know more today than a decade ago how gains can be achieved. We may expect new major innovations to come to fruition in the next 10 years as well. But we may expect new crises to emerge, even if we do not know yet what those may be.

Guidance is provided considering the diversity of countries the AU serves and their varying needs, and the fact that to transform their education systems, Member States and other stakeholders need to do more and better with limited resources.

This resulted in 69 AAs or recommendations. The document had the benefit of being relatively short and easy to read, but it did not provide a discussion of the empirical evidence for its recommendations and the potential trade-offs between objectives. The document also may not have conveyed strong priorities, in part because it aimed to be very comprehensive. As another approach, a strategy can be more focused on a few key objectives with more detailed analysis of how to achieve these objectives. This is, in a way, the approach now used by the Global Partnership for Education (GPE) in supporting countries based on a compact with priorities for support. It is also the approach used by the World Bank for its Western and Central Africa Education Strategy<sup>18</sup>, a lengthier and more complex document with a series of background notes providing detailed analysis. That strategy provided more guidance for the areas it covered, but it was not as comprehensive as CESA 16-25 in terms of what it covered. Both approaches have potential benefits and drawbacks, and both approaches may serve different purposes or audiences.\nCESA 26-35 aims to straddle a middle ground, providing some analysis and outlining a comprehensive framework for action while remaining relatively short as a document. The strategy aims to avoid the risk of going too much into details and losing the big picture, and that of going for the big picture but remaining at the surface so-to-speak with recommendations that may be too generic to be practically useful. Keeping in mind this twin challenge, and the need to keep the document relatively short, five simple principles (ABCDE) were adopted to draft the strategy and trying to make it both thorough and user-friendly (Box 1).\nBox 1: ABCDE Principles for Drafting CESA 26-35\nAdaptable.

CESA 26-35 aims to be relatively brief, at about 50 pages when professionally formatted. Shorter documents are more likely to be read, especially by policymakers. The strategy does not replace more detailed continental analyses of education in Africa<sup>19</sup>. It is meant to provide a framework for action.\nConsultative.

Education is a human right and is key to promoting peace and sustainable development. But there is also a wealth of data demonstrating the private as opposed to social benefits from education. In Africa and globally, human capital wealth, which is based on earnings and is driven in large part by education, accounts for about two thirds of the changing wealth of nations, a much larger share than natural or produced capital. The human capital index, another measure, is heavily influenced by educational outcomes based on evidence of high rates of returns to education in labor markets. Apart from higher earnings, education is associated with many other benefits, including lower adult mortality<sup>21</sup>. For girls and women, education is associated with lower rates of maternal mortality and intimate partner violence, higher knowledge of health issues, and better decision-making ability. Their children are less likely to die by age five or be stunted. Better educated women also have lower total fertility rates, which can help usher a demographic dividend<sup>22</sup>. This first part of the strategy briefly reviews some of the benefits of education, considering (i) Human rights, peace, and sustainable development; (ii) Labor market benefits; and (iii) Other benefits. Selected recent studies on the cost of inaction (i.e., the cost of not providing adequate educational opportunities) are also mentioned.\nHuman Rights, Peace, and Sustainable Development\nEducation is a human right, and it contributes to the ability of individuals to exercise other human rights. While CESA 16-25 did not mention explicitly the right to education or human rights in general, it referred to Agenda 2063 which does refer to human rights. The right to education is enshrined in Article 26 of the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights<sup>23</sup>, Article 28 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child<sup>24</sup> and Article 11 of the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child<sup>25</sup>. These articles emphasize the need for states to provide free and compulsory basic education, which should include at least one year of pre-primary education. The right to education contributes to the ability of individuals to exercise other human rights, as often argued when pointing to indivisibility of human rights<sup>26</sup>. Importantly, the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights and subsequent human rights instruments refer to links between education and culture, emphasizing (1) the maintenance of peace and the right for parents to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children; and (2) the importance of morals and traditional values. The right to education is not only about schooling and the acquisition of skills valuable for the labor market: it is also about communities and societies. This was recognized in CESA 16-25, including in its tenth strategic objective on peace education and the prevention and resolution of conflicts. This broader contribution of education to development remains relevant today.\nEducation is key for peace and sustainable development. According to the Futures of Education report<sup>27</sup>, we may be at a unique juncture in history. Sociological, ecological and technological trends are affecting education systems in profound and yet uncertain ways, putting a premium on the ability to adapt. The report calls for a new social contract and stronger global solidarity and international cooperation in education. It also notes that the role of education for peace and sustainable development is crucial. These themes were also at the core of the Transforming Education Summit in New York in 2022<sup>28</sup>. Conflicts have been rising globally and in Africa, and the threat of climate change, while already known when CESA 16-25 was adopted, has become even more pressing today<sup>29</sup>. Education has a unique role to play in promoting social cohesion, peace<sup>30</sup>, and sustainable development, including care for the planet. There is also a pressing need to ensure that refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) benefit from education.\nHealth and Social Benefits\nEducation is associated with major health and social benefits, including for girls and women. There is a dose-response relationship with all-cause adult mortality, with an average reduction in mortality risk of 1.9% per additional year of education for men and women alike and across socio-demographic index levels<sup>31</sup>. In addition, for girls and women, as well as for their children, education brings additional benefits. A review already published over a decade ago suggested that an additional year of education among women of reproductive age was associated with a 9.5% reduction in infant mortality<sup>32</sup>.

In Africa and globally, human capital wealth, which is based on earnings and is driven in large part by education, accounts for about two thirds of the changing wealth of nations, a much larger share than natural or produced capital. The human capital index, another measure, is heavily influenced by educational outcomes based on evidence of high rates of returns to education in labor markets. Apart from higher earnings, education is associated with many other benefits, including lower adult mortality<sup>21</sup>. For girls and women, education is associated with lower rates of maternal mortality and intimate partner violence, higher knowledge of health issues, and better decision-making ability. Their children are less likely to die by age five or be stunted. Better educated women also have lower total fertility rates, which can help usher a demographic dividend<sup>22</sup>. This first part of the strategy briefly reviews some of the benefits of education, considering (i) Human rights, peace, and sustainable development; (ii) Labor market benefits; and (iii) Other benefits. Selected recent studies on the cost of inaction (i.e., the cost of not providing adequate educational opportunities) are also mentioned.\n\n## Human Rights, Peace, and Sustainable Development\n\nEducation is a human right, and it contributes to the ability of individuals to exercise other human rights. While CESA 16-25 did not mention explicitly the right to education or human rights in general, it referred to Agenda 2063 which does refer to human rights. The right to education is enshrined in Article 26 of the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights<sup>23</sup>, Article 28 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child<sup>24</sup> and Article 11 of the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child<sup>25</sup>. These articles emphasize the need for states to provide free and compulsory basic education, which should include at least one year of pre-primary education. The right to education contributes to the ability of individuals to exercise other human rights, as often argued when pointing to indivisibility of human rights<sup>26</sup>. Importantly, the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights and subsequent human rights instruments refer to links between education and culture, emphasizing (1) the maintenance of peace and the right for parents to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children; and (2) the importance of morals and traditional values. The right to education is not only about schooling and the acquisition of skills valuable for the labor market: it is also about communities and societies. This was recognized in CESA 16-25, including in its tenth strategic objective on peace education and the prevention and resolution of conflicts. This broader contribution of education to development remains relevant today.\n\nEducation is key for peace and sustainable development. According to the Futures of Education report<sup>27</sup>, we may be at a unique juncture in history. Sociological, ecological and technological trends are affecting education systems in profound and yet uncertain ways, putting a premium on the ability to adapt. The report calls for a new social contract and stronger global solidarity and international cooperation in education. It also notes that the role of education for peace and sustainable development is crucial. These themes were also at the core of the Transforming Education Summit in New York in 2022<sup>28</sup>. Conflicts have been rising globally and in Africa, and the threat of climate change, while already known when CESA 16-25 was adopted, has become even more pressing today<sup>29</sup>. Education has a unique role to play in promoting social cohesion, peace<sup>30</sup>, and sustainable development, including care for the planet. There is also a pressing need to ensure that refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) benefit from education.\n\n## Health and Social Benefits\n\nEducation is associated with major health and social benefits, including for girls and women. There is a dose-response relationship with all-cause adult mortality, with an average reduction in mortality risk of 1.9% per additional year of education for men and women alike and across socio-demographic index levels<sup>31</sup>. In addition, for girls and women, as well as for their children, education brings additional benefits. A review already published over a decade ago suggested that an additional year of education among women of reproductive age was associated with a 9.5% reduction in infant mortality<sup>32</sup>.

Key findings are as follows<sup>33</sup>:\nChild marriage and early childbearing: If all girls completed their secondary education, child marriage could be virtually eliminated, and the risk of early childbearing reduced by two thirds. This matters, given the negative effects of child marriage and early pregnancies not only for girls throughout their lifetime, but also for their families, communities, and societies.\nFertility rates and population growth: With universal secondary education for girls, fertility rates (the number of children that women have over their lifetime) could be reduced by a third<sup>34</sup>, reducing population growth and potentially ushering a demographic dividend (see Box 2).\nHealth, nutrition, and well-being: Low educational attainment for women is associated with a lower ability to seek care, a lack of knowledge about health, and higher maternal mortality, among other risks. A lack of education also increases the risk of intimate partner violence. For children, being born of a mother younger than 18 increases the risks of under-five mortality and stunting and lowered developmental potential.\nAgency and decision-making: Low educational attainment for women affects their agency and decision-making ability within the household. Under universal secondary education, an index of women’s decision-making ability would increase on average by 15 percent of the base values.\nSocial capital: Higher educational attainment is associated with societal benefits. For example, better educated individuals are in a position in life that makes it easier for them to engage in altruistic behaviors such as contributing to charity, volunteered time, or helping strangers<sup>35</sup>. Social capital and the ability to get help when in need may also be affected by educational attainment<sup>36</sup>.\nCost of inaction: Conversely, not investing in education today would lead again in those areas in a high cost of inaction. Better educational opportunities for girls would generate higher welfare and lower poverty as well as budget savings for households, communities, and Member States due to reduced pressure on the delivery of basic services. These savings could in turn be used to improve the quality of the services being provided, including educational services.\nBox 2: Reaping the Benefits of the Demographic Dividend\nWhile different definitions of the demographic dividend have been proposed, the term is associated with improvements in standards of living and accelerated economic growth when a country achieves a population structure that is favorable thanks to a reduction in birth (and death) rates that is followed by rapid fertility decline. As a result, the share of the population of working-age individuals may increase sharply for some time, which tends to generate faster economic growth<sup>37</sup>. In addition, with lower dependency ratios, households are better able to support themselves and invest among others in education, nutrition, and health or, more broadly, human development<sup>38</sup>. These investments in turn may lead younger generations to be better educated and more productive in adulthood. This demographic and human capital transition may help reduce poverty rates dramatically. Achieving universal secondary education for girls should help reduce population growth and improve skills levels in countries where fertility rates remain high, thereby helping to usher in the demographic dividend.\nLabor Market Benefits\nThere is also a large literature on the returns to education in labor markets. An example of estimates of labor market returns to education for West African countries is provided in Box 3. More generally, without going into details, data on human capital illustrate both the importance of education and the challenges faced by Africa. Two measures of human capital – the Human Capital Index and Human Capital Wealth, point to the benefits of investments in education, but also to the fact that Africa is not achieving its economic potential in part because of insufficient investments in education. This leads to a high “cost of inaction.”\nHuman Capital Index (HCI): The HCI aims to measure how productive children, and youth may be in adulthood based on indicators related to education and health. The index is computed with five variables likely to affect future earnings<sup>39</sup>. The value of the index is the ratio of the expected future productivity of today’s children and youth to the productivity that they could reach achieve with full education and health. Data are available for 50 African countries. Weighting all countries equally, the average HCI was at 0.42 in 2020 in Africa, suggesting that children and youth may reach in adulthood on average only 42 percent of the earnings they could aspire to with full health and education.

National wealth can be measured as the sum of: (1) Produced capital, which comes from investments in assets such as factories, equipment, or infrastructure; (2) Natural capital, which consists of assets such as agricultural land and both renewable and nonrenewable natural resources; (3) Human capital, measured as the present value of the future earnings of the labor force; and (4) Net foreign assets<sup>41</sup>. HCW accounts for over 60 percent of national wealth in Africa and globally, with education itself accounting for a large share of HCW. This underscores the importance of education for development. One key challenge, though, is that women have much lower levels of HCW than men, in part because of lower educational attainment, but more so because of lower labor force participation and occupational discrimination or segregation whereby women tend to work in lower productivity sectors. Reducing gender inequality in HCW through education could dramatically increase HCW and total wealth in Africa, thereby boosting the assets base that will enable the continent’s future development<sup>42</sup>.\nCost of inaction: All those effects have important implications. As a recent example of estimates of the cost of inaction (i.e., the cost of not improving educational outcomes), a new report estimates the global cost of unmet educational needs by 2030 at US $10 trillion<sup>43</sup>. In sub-Saharan Africa, the cost of children leaving school early and having less than basic skills may represent 19% and 26% of the continent’s GDP, respectively. While such estimates depend on assumptions and estimations have limitations, the cost of inaction in education is clearly very high.\nBox 3: Labor Market Returns to Educational Attainment and Literacy in West Africa\nEstimates of HCW are based on estimates of rates of return using a large database of household surveys. To illustrate gains in earnings associated with education, Figure 1 provides estimates of those gains with various levels of education in nine West African countries using data on wage earnings from the 2018-19 Enquête harmonisée sur les conditions de vie des ménages. A few key findings emerge, which tend also to be observed in other studies and are important for the discussion in this strategy: (1) gains in earnings from primary education are relatively low, possibly because too many children are not learning enough in school, but gains from literacy are higher, suggesting the importance of imparting foundational skills; (2) gains increase at the secondary level, and for this sample broadly similar at the upper secondary level between the general track and TVET; and (3) gains are largest as expected for higher education.

All countries face challenges in improving their educational outcomes, but the challenges are daunting in Africa where levels of enrollment and completion remain low, and children do not learn enough in school. These outcomes are the results of weak enabling environments, including a lack of adequate policies and governance, shortfalls in budget allocations and execution, and a lack of coordination, all of which lead to supply-side challenges (inadequate physical infrastructure, lack of qualified and motivated teachers, outdated curricula, etc.) When combined with demand-side challenges such as poverty, limited engagement of parents and communities in schools, social norms, and other constraints, the result is limited progress in improving educational outcomes. For teachers, educators, and caregivers, insufficient qualifications, low levels of pay, and high level of stress especially in emergency contexts are not conducive to great teaching and learning. Pressures from climate change and conflicts add to the mix, as does the fact that many parents are illiterate and may not be able to support their children's learning at home. Finally, and importantly, compounding these constraints is another major limitation: because such a large share of the population is in age of schooling and because the cost of providing education is often higher as a share of GDP than in other regions, African countries have difficulties in financing their education systems adequately. This is especially the case today given high levels of debt. These issues are briefly discussed in this section, focusing on (i) schooling; (ii) learning and skills; and (iii) education financing. This is followed by a summary of some of the lessons learned from the CESA 16-25 Review.\nSchooling\nProgress has been achieved in enrollment and completion rates in the last ten years, but the rate of progress is slow. Table 1 provides completion rates by level for primary, lower secondary (L. Sec.) and Upper secondary (U. Sec.) education (data are not available for higher education completion rates).\nLimited progress: Table 1 suggests limited progress since CESA 16-25 was adopted. Enrollment and completion rates remain low with most countries likely to fall far short of SDG4 targets by 2030. In addition, data over a longer period than provided in Table 1 suggests that the rate of progress may have slowed, with for many indicators less progress in the last decade than before.\nGender parity: At the aggregate level, parity has been broadly achieved in pre-primary enrollment. Girls have caught up with boys at the primary and lower secondary levels, but less so at higher levels of schooling. In some countries however, including in the Sahel as well as among the poor in many countries, there is still much to do to promote better educational opportunities for girls.\nEnrollment in pre-primary and higher education: Although not shown in the Table, data are also available for enrollment in pre-primary and higher education, with again limited progress (in sub-Saharan Africa for example, less than one in three children are enrolled in pre-primary education, and just one in ten youth of the relevant age group are enrolled in higher education).\nSDG4 benchmarks: More details on the extent to which countries have made progress towards SDG4 benchmarks are available in a scorecard from UIS and the Global Education Monitoring Report team.

Traditional indicators used for measuring progress in educational outcomes used to focus on enrollment rates (for pre-primary and tertiary education) and completion rates (for primary and secondary education). Today, a stronger focus is placed on learning while in school. Estimates for primary education suggest a learning crisis with few students achieving minimum proficiency in math and reading, especially in sub-Saharan Africa (Table 2)<sup>46</sup>. Note that in Northern Africa, Egypt and Morocco take part in grade 4 assessments in reading, but data on student proficiency tends not to be readily available for many countries.\nTable 2: Trends in Student Learning in Primary School Since the Adoption of CESA 16-25 (%)\n| Year               | Students in Grade 2 or 3<br/>Minimum proficiency in math (%) | Students in Grade 2 or 3<br/>Minimum proficiency in reading (%) | Students at end of primary<br/>Minimum proficiency in math (%) | Students at end of primary<br/>Minimum proficiency in reading (%) |\n| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Sub-Saharan Africa |                                                              |                                                                 |                                                                |                                                                   |\n| 2016               | 50.5                                                         | 34.9                                                            | 11.9                                                           | 30.8                                                              |\n| Latest             | 51.6                                                         | 36.2                                                            | 11.2                                                           | 30.2                                                              |\n| Difference         | +1.1                                                         | +1.3                                                            | -0.7                                                           | -0.6                                                              |\n\nSource: UNESCO Institute of Statistics. Estimates are pre-COVID since the latest year for available data at the time of writing is 2019. Simulations suggest an increase in learning poverty during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have affected learning further. Using a different measure of learning than the measure reported for reading proficiency in Table 2, it is estimated that up to nine in ten children may be \"learning poor\" in sub-Saharan Africa, i.e., not able to read and understand a simple text by age 10. The estimates are based on (i) the share of children aged 10 who are out of school, with all those children considered as learning poor; (ii) the share of children who are in school but still not able to read and understand a simple text (those children are \"learning deprived\")<sup>47</sup>. Globally, almost half of all children in low and middle-income countries were considered learning poor before the COVID-19 pandemic, but in sub-Saharan Africa and low-income countries, learning poverty was much higher. The magnitude of the impact of the pandemic on learning poverty is not yet known, but simulations suggest it may be large<sup>48</sup>. Before the pandemic, the target set by the World Bank in partnership with UN agencies was to reduce learning poverty in half by 2030. That target is unlikely to be achieved<sup>49</sup>, with potentially severe implications for the likelihood that children will remain in school (see Box 4).\n26 ▶ CONTINENTAL EDUCATION STRATEGY FOR AFRICA 2026-2035: A Framework for Action March 2025",

Traditional indicators used for measuring progress in educational outcomes used to focus on enrollment rates (for pre-primary and tertiary education) and completion rates (for primary and secondary education). Today, a stronger focus is placed on learning while in school. Estimates for primary education suggest a learning crisis with few students achieving minimum proficiency in math and reading, especially in sub-Saharan Africa (Table 2)<sup>46</sup>. Note that in Northern Africa, Egypt and Morocco take part in grade 4 assessments in reading, but data on student proficiency tends not to be readily available for many countries.\n\n**Table 2: Trends in Student Learning in Primary School Since the Adoption of CESA 16-25 (%)**\n\n| Year               | Students in Grade 2 or 3<br/>Minimum proficiency in math (%) | Students in Grade 2 or 3<br/>Minimum proficiency in reading (%) | Students at end of primary<br/>Minimum proficiency in math (%) | Students at end of primary<br/>Minimum proficiency in reading (%) |\n| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Sub-Saharan Africa |                                                              |                                                                 |                                                                |                                                                   |\n| 2016               | 50.5                                                         | 34.9                                                            | 11.9                                                           | 30.8                                                              |\n| Latest             | 51.6                                                         | 36.2                                                            | 11.2                                                           | 30.2                                                              |\n| Difference         | +1.1                                                         | +1.3                                                            | -0.7                                                           | -0.6                                                              |\n\nSource: UNESCO Institute of Statistics. Estimates are pre-COVID since the latest year for available data at the time of writing is 2019. Simulations suggest an increase in learning poverty during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have affected learning further. Using a different measure of learning than the measure reported for reading proficiency in Table 2, it is estimated that up to nine in ten children may be \"learning poor\" in sub-Saharan Africa, i.e., not able to read and understand a simple text by age 10. The estimates are based on (i) the share of children aged 10 who are out of school, with all those children considered as learning poor; (ii) the share of children who are in school but still not able to read and understand a simple text (those children are \"learning deprived\")<sup>47</sup>. Globally, almost half of all children in low and middle-income countries were considered learning poor before the COVID-19 pandemic, but in sub-Saharan Africa and low-income countries, learning poverty was much higher. The magnitude of the impact of the pandemic on learning poverty is not yet known, but simulations suggest it may be large<sup>48</sup>. Before the pandemic, the target set by the World Bank in partnership with UN agencies was to reduce learning poverty in half by 2030. That target is unlikely to be achieved<sup>49</sup>, with potentially severe implications for the likelihood that children will remain in school (see Box 4).\n\n26 ▶ CONTINENTAL EDUCATION STRATEGY FOR AFRICA 2026-2035: A Framework for Action March 2025",

While the issues of insufficient schooling and learning are often discussed separately, they are closely linked with lack of learning being a major factor for students to drop out of school.

The challenges are again massive as Africa will account for most of the growth in the working-age population in coming decades. The OECD<sup>52</sup> estimates that the number of Africans that will complete upper secondary or tertiary education will be more than doubled between 2020 and 2040. What types of jobs these youth may have access to is a concern. Manufacturing and other high productivity jobs remain rare, forcing youths to join the informal sector, including the agriculture and retail sectors that are labor-intensive, but also often low productivity. The structural transformation of African economies remains slow, leading some of the best educated to look for work outside of Africa, thereby contributing to brain drain. As the jobs of the future will require digital and other advanced skills, education systems must equip children and youth with those skills. This should include a stronger focus on STEAM education to ensure that youths can harness the technological revolution.\nEducation Financing\nDespite calls for higher investments in education, education financing is falling behind, with unfavorable medium-term prospects due to high debt burdens. There is a strong relationship between a country's level of economic development and its investment in education. While low-income countries spend an average of US$60 per capita on education, the investment is at US$250 in lower-middle income countries, US$900 in upper-middle income countries, and around US$8,000 in high income countries<sup>53</sup>. In many African countries, an additional issue is that budget execution rates are low. As a result, there is broad consensus today that public funding for education should increase in Africa, and so should official development assistance (ODA) and other potential funding even if these resources represent only a small fraction of what governments allocate to education systems. Unfortunately, in Africa public funding for education has decreased in proportional terms rather than increased in recent years, with ODA also not faring well. Table 2 provide data on: (i) Public expenditure on education as a percentage of total government expenditure; and (ii) Public expenditure on education as a percentage of GDP. For the median country, expenditure on education declined as a share of total government expenditure since CESA was adopted, while government expenditure on education remained flat as a share of GDP. The values in Table 2 fall short of United Nations recommendations, as discussed in Part III. There is a risk that governments may not be able or willing to increase funding for education in the medium-term due to high levels of debt.\nTable 2: Trends in Education Financing Since the Adoption of CESA 16-25 (%)\n| Indicators                                                                            | 2016 | Latest Data |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---- | ----------- |\n| Expenditure on education as share of total government expenditure (%, median country) | 16.0 | 14.5        |\n| Government expenditure on education, total (% of GDP)                                 | 3.7  | 3.7         |\n\nSource: UNESCO Global Education Monitoring Report Team.

CESA 16-25 awareness among respondents was relatively high, and respondents tended to find the strategy useful, but relatively few used the strategy beyond simply citing it or referring to its objectives. In terms of the assessment of the impact of the strategy in countries or in Africa, it was deemed average. For respondents not aware of the strategy, lack of awareness was an obvious reason for lack of impact, but lack of funding and lack of capacity as well as other reasons were also cited as constraints. Lack of support from RECs, lack of consultation, and lack of capacity were also cited as constraints to the strategy's impact. Of note, respondents found virtually all SOs of the strategy to be important for education in Africa.\nMany respondents were aware of CESA clusters and many of their organizations participated in some of their activities, but the cluster mechanism needs strengthening. Respondents in the surveys were asked if they were aware of the CESA clusters and whether to their knowledge their organization had participated in any of the clusters. Most respondents were indeed aware of the clusters, and quite a few participated. This is encouraging. However, many clusters are not currently operating well enough. Based on various indicators, less than half of clusters appear to have been highly operational recently.

Still, this suggests room for improvement. Participants in functioning clusters find them useful, but lack of funding is seen as a key impediment.\nCESA 16-25 envisioned a robust monitoring framework, but monitoring progress has been challenging. As mentioned, CESA 16-25 was structured around 12 SOs with 69 intermediate-level goals or AAs that were identified critical elements for achieving the SOs.

As discussed earlier, gains have been limited over the last decade, not only in terms of educational outcomes, but also in the funding available for education. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic played a role, but the challenges are more fundamental. The slow rate of progress should not be attributed to CESA 16-25 since the primary responsibility for improving educational outcomes lies with Member States. But whether at the country, regional, or continental level, slow progress must be acknowledged in this strategy<sup>54</sup>. This being said, as noted among others in the recent Transforming Education Summit, while limited progress has been achieved in the last decade, there are major opportunities to accelerate progress going forward. Suggesting how this could be done is the rationale for this new strategy.\nThe strategy aims to contribute to AU’s vision by identifying strategic areas for investments in education and specific objectives that can be measured over time. The AU vision is \"An integrated, prosperous and peaceful Africa, driven by its own citizens and representing a dynamic force in global arena.\" The aim of CESA 26-35 is to provide guidance to Member States, RECs, and other education stakeholders towards improving educational outcomes in the next decade, in line with the aspirations of Agenda 2063 and the Sustainable Development Goals 2030 that will continue to inform the strategy for the first half of its timing horizon. The hope is that CESA 26-35 will be helpful to Member States, RECs, and other stakeholders as they develop and implement transformative, relevant, and inclusive education strategies and policies, thereby contributing to economic development in a sustainable way as well as peace and social cohesion. In what follows, a framework for action with six strategic areas (SAs) and a brief discussion for each area.\nIt should be emphasized however that African countries have diverse development trajectories and therefore diverse needs. For this strategy to remain relatively brief, this cannot be discussed here, but it should be clear that objectives outlined in this strategy may be more or less salient for different countries.\nVision, Framework, and Rationale\nThe vision adopted in CESA 16-25 remains appropriate for CESA 26-35. As noted in CESA 16-25, Agenda 2063 envisions a \"peaceful and prosperous Africa, integrated, led by its own citizens and occupying the place it deserves in the global community and in the knowledge economy.\" CESA 16-25 was meant to deliver the necessary human capital for the realization of this Vision. The mission of CESA 16-25 was \"Reorienting Africa’s education and training systems to meet the knowledge, competencies, skills, innovation and creativity required to nurture African core values and promote sustainable development at the national, sub-regional and continental levels.\" This vision remains appropriate for CESA 26-35.\nThe framework for action for CESA 26-35 consists of six strategic areas (SAs) with three objectives per SA and two more objectives for implementation and for monitoring and evaluation. The SAs are:\nSA1: Resources and enabling environment. This broad SA covers issues from pre-primary to higher education related to funding, governance, infrastructure, curriculum and learning resources, and sector-wide policy, including a recognition of the fact that different service providers (public, private, faith-based, and others) contribute in important ways to education systems.\nSA2: Teachers, educators, and caregivers. This SA covers issues pertaining to the recruitment, career progression, and professional development of teachers, educators or instructors (e.g., for TVET), and caregivers (e.g., for children under 3 years old) as well as their well-being. This relates to salaries and benefits, but also to leadership and accountability, and to teachers’ mental health and motivation.\nSA3: Pre-primary to secondary education, with a focus on early learning and foundational, socio-emotional, and 21<sup>st</sup> century and labor market skills. This SA focuses on outcomes for learners, recognizing the different types of skills that they need to acquire, as well as the fact that schools should promote health and well-being among students as well as 21st century skills, including\n30 ▶ CONTINENTAL EDUCATION STRATEGY FOR AFRICA 2026-2035: A Framework for Action March 2025",

While fully endorsing the strategy and recommending its adoption, participants in the 5th specialized technical committee meeting held in November 2024 noted the importance of reducing brain drain in Africa by encouraging talent retention, including through innovative entrepreneurship in the EdTech sector, local opportunities, and an emphasis on the value of African expertise<sup>57</sup> (as considered in SA 3 and SA 4). The experts meeting for the specialized technical committee<sup>58</sup> also stressed the need for the strategy to encourage the inclusion of displaced people and people with disabilities, prioritize inclusive education and equity-focused approaches (as emphasized in SA 6), and ensure that the grant financing architecture facilitates the acquisition of skills for the labor market (as emphasized in SA3). Participants also stressed the role of the private sector in training processes especially for TVET (as emphasized in SA4) competency-based education, and life-long learning (as emphasized in SA5). Finally, participants stressed the importance of continuous professional development for teachers and school leaders (as emphasized in SA2) and the need for collaborations and partnerships for increased investments in education.\n32 ▶ CONTINENTAL EDUCATION STRATEGY FOR AFRICA 2026-2035: A Framework for Action March 2025",

While fully endorsing the strategy and recommending its adoption, participants in the 5th specialized technical committee meeting held in November 2024 noted the importance of reducing brain drain in Africa by encouraging talent retention, including through innovative entrepreneurship in the EdTech sector, local opportunities, and an emphasis on the value of African expertise<sup>57</sup> (as considered in SA 3 and SA 4). The experts meeting for the specialized technical committee<sup>58</sup> also stressed the need for the strategy to encourage the inclusion of displaced people and people with disabilities, prioritize inclusive education and equity-focused approaches (as emphasized in SA 6), and ensure that the grant financing architecture facilitates the acquisition of skills for the labor market (as emphasized in SA3). Participants also stressed the role of the private sector in training processes especially for TVET (as emphasized in SA4) competency-based education, and life-long learning (as emphasized in SA5). Finally, participants stressed the importance of continuous professional development for teachers and school leaders (as emphasized in SA2) and the need for collaborations and partnerships for increased investments in education.\n\n32 ▶ CONTINENTAL EDUCATION STRATEGY FOR AFRICA 2026-2035: A Framework for Action March 2025",

The number of objectives under CESA 26-35 is smaller than the number of AAs in CESA 16-25. This is intentional as the number of objectives was capped at 20 to convey prioritization, although what was included in CESA 16-25 is still included in CESA 26-35, albeit at a higher level of aggregation.

Without going into too many details, a few points may be helpful regarding the aims of CESA 26-35, SAs and objectives, implementation, and monitoring:\nAims of CESA 26-35: As noted in the CESA 16-25 review, there is a difference between strategies providing guidance for multiple stakeholders and strategies implemented by a single organization, in this case the AU. Most of the \"action\" for improving educational outcomes in Africa is at the country where Member States and other stakeholders create their own strategies or sector plans and implement them. This means that CESA 26-35 must remain at a somewhat broad level, without going too much into the weeds, and provide guidance recognizing that some SAs or objectives may be more relevant for some countries or regions than others. This suggests that CESA 26-35 should not be prescriptive but rather indicative of issues to pay attention to.\nNumber of SAs and objectives: A good practice in strategies is to not have too many areas of focus, so that there is prioritization. For monitoring, a limited number of objectives is beneficial too. But there is an additional reason for keeping the number of SAs and objectives small: the AU has adopted or is in the process of adopting other strategies and instruments relevant to education, and some of the strategies it has adopted outside of the Education Sector are relevant for that sector. As illustrated in Figure 5, this is the case for strategies related, among others, to (i) science, technology, and innovation (STISA); (ii) Digital transformation; (iii) Artificial intelligence; and (iv) Youth employment (YES). Within the Education Sector, strategies have also been developed – this is the case among others for TVET and for Education for Health and Well-being. Apart from strategies, the AU has also developed a range of instruments, for example related to teachers. More detailed recommendations can and should be provided in those strategies and instruments, with CESA 16-25 serving as an overarching vision leaving more detailed guidance to other documents.\nStructure of SAs: After foundations (first two SAs), the focus is on basic education, followed by Higher Education and TVET. In many countries different Ministries oversee these sub-sectors. Providing guidance by sub-sector therefore matches the decision-making process. Second chance programs and lifelong learning are combined because they both target individuals not in school.\nMarch 2025 CONTINENTAL EDUCATION STRATEGY FOR AFRICA 2026-2035: A Framework for Action ◀ 33",

Without going into too many details, a few points may be helpful regarding the aims of CESA 26-35, SAs and objectives, implementation, and monitoring:\n\n**Aims of CESA 26-35:** As noted in the CESA 16-25 review, there is a difference between strategies providing guidance for multiple stakeholders and strategies implemented by a single organization, in this case the AU. Most of the \"action\" for improving educational outcomes in Africa is at the country where Member States and other stakeholders create their own strategies or sector plans and implement them. This means that CESA 26-35 must remain at a somewhat broad level, without going too much into the weeds, and provide guidance recognizing that some SAs or objectives may be more relevant for some countries or regions than others.

Regarding partnerships, development partners (DPs), civil society organizations (CSOs), the private sector, communities including traditional and religious leaders, and families all have a role to play towards improving education systems.\nGuidance: Guidance on policies for various SAs will be discussed in relationship to those SAs, but at a broader level, an interesting source is the short Partnership Compact Guidelines of GPE since the advice provided therein has broader application as well<sup>60</sup>. Technical guidance for policy analysis is also available<sup>61</sup>. On funding, the latest guidance from the United Nations Secretary-General’s High-level Panel on the Teaching Profession<sup>62</sup> calls for governments to allocate at least 6 per cent of gross domestic product and 20 per cent of total government expenditure to education. This may not be easy, given relatively high levels of debt in many countries<sup>63</sup>, but recent analysis by UNICEF and the African Union suggests options for increasing education spending<sup>64</sup>. Targets have also been proposed for public education expenditure for various sub-sectors. On governance and partnerships, the role of the private sector in education provision remains disputed, but guidance is available in the Global Education Monitoring Report on non-state actors in education<sup>65</sup>. Guidance is also available for specific sub-sectors, for example for TVET<sup>66</sup>. Across sectors, evidence-based approaches require data. A recent UNESCO Conference on Education Statistics led to a range of decisions that are also relevant for Africa, including on administrative data, teacher data, education expenditure data, learning assessments and skills, household surveys, and other data<sup>67</sup>. At the AU, education data are the focus of the Pan-African Institute for Education for Development’s (AU/IPED) which works with Member States on promoting robust and functional Education Management Information Systems (EMIS), and strengthening national capacity to collect, analyze and report on education data.\nObjective #2: Upgrade curricula to reflect current and emerging challenges\nImportance: Curricula are what is taught, learned, and assessed. They are part of the foundations of education systems. There is a need to upgrade curricula among others to: (i) improve foundational skills to fight learning poverty; (ii) promote socio-emotional skills; and (iii) strengthen labor market and 21<sup>st</sup> century skills such as communication, creativity and innovation, critical thinking, decision making, problem solving, and teamwork, not to mention more technical skills such as digital literacy or skills related to STEAM. There is also a need to move towards competency-based curricula and make curricula gender-transformative, while ensuring that education promotes peace and global citizenship. Ensuring when feasible that young children are taught in their native language is also a priority. Challenges such as climate change and AI require adaptations to make curricula more endogenous, including for values (e.g., through Ubuntu and other relevant approaches) and history (e.g., with reference to resources from the General History of Africa). How curricula are designed also has implications for the cost of providing education. At the secondary level, some curricula may be too complex, leading to higher costs than needed. At the tertiary level, curriculum reform for Teacher Training Institutions (TTIs) and university-based Schools of Education is a priority, given that they train future teachers, with attention given to the science of learning, practice-oriented training, and efficient feedback loops for testing of new curricula. Finally, there are opportunities to harmonize curriculum development at the regional or continental level, for example for foundational education standards related to literacy and numeracy.\nGuidance: For young children, there is a need to ensure developmentally sound approaches to learning including through play<sup>68</sup>. On improving foundational skills to fight learning poverty, guidance is available from a World Bank report<sup>69</sup> that emphasizes cost-effective approaches, including among others structured pedagogy and teaching at the right level (see also Objective #4 below). On competency-based curricula, experiences are available from some of the countries that pioneered the shift<sup>70</sup>. Another promising intervention is teaching in the child’s own language in the early grades. On ICT and STEAM, and 21st century skills, guidance will be discussed below. On education for peace and the prevention of violence, various guides have been prepared by teachers<sup>71</sup>. On history, a major reference is the General History of Africa, a long-standing project aiming to reconstruct Africa’s history from an African perspective and for which online courses and other pedagogic materials are being developed, targeting students and the general public for lifelong learning perspectives. On climate change, a wide range of new resources are also being developed<sup>72</sup>. As for climate change, resources on integrating AI in the curriculum are growing<sup>73</sup>.\nObjective #3: Expand and upgrade infrastructure and the learning environment\nImportance: Lack of availability and accessibility of decent schools continues to be obstacles to quality education, especially in countries with a rapidly increasing school-age population where pressure from high population growth makes it harder to provide services. There is insufficient investment funding to expand the educational infrastructure at all levels from early childhood to higher education, with funding also often lacking for maintenance and upgrade which reduces buildings’ life expectancy.

      "text": "the number of teachers needed is much smaller since most countries will not reach SDG4 targets (as discussed earlier, limited progress has been achieved in boosting enrollment rates). Still, the number of teachers needed will remain substantial, and there is also a need to improve the quality of the current teacher force. To recruit new teachers and empower and retain current teachers, governments will need to ensure that the profession is attractive enough, which is not the case today in many countries, including in terms of wages and benefits and working conditions (acknowledging that increasing salaries and benefits is no panacea and has cost implications). In addition, there is a need to find ways to increase the prestige of the profession. In many countries, the profession may not have any more the respect it once commanded. Still another issue is the (lack) of gender balance among teachers with different challenges by level of education and depending on the level of economic development of countries.\nGuidance: Many of the references mentioned for the previous objective also discuss issues related to improving the attractiveness of the profession. This may require improving salaries and other benefit (e.g., medical insurance, housing, transport allowance, pensions, etc.), especially for women who often lag men in pay. Data also suggest that many teachers are stressed. Improving school leadership and providing mental health and psycho-social support could also help, the later especially in contexts of emergencies. Incentives may also be needed to ensure that remote and fragile areas have the teachers they need. Importantly, the situation of teachers, educators, and caregivers is not the same across countries. In some countries, teachers and other educators are better paid than other individuals with similar levels of education and experience. In other countries, they are less well paid. Conducting diagnostics is therefore encouraged, considering that changes in teacher pay and benefits have major budget implications. Conducting job satisfaction surveys can help MoEs and Teacher Service Commissions assess the morale of their workforce and what could increase satisfaction and motivation. Implementing Teacher Awards schemes can also be beneficial to signal to teachers and to society at large the value of the profession<sup>90</sup>.\nBox 5: A Strategy on Mental Health and Psychosocial Support for Teachers\nAs part of the process for the preparation and approval of CESA 26-35, a Continental Education Strategy on Mental Health and Psychosocial Support for Teachers in Africa (CS-MHPSS) was also approved<sup>91</sup>. The strategy contributed to the CESA 26-35 objective #5 namely increasing the attractiveness of the teaching profession. It provides guidance on how to contribute to better mental health for teachers, building on existing global, regional, and national policies and frameworks related to teacher wellbeing, including WHO and ILO guidance. CS-MHPSS aims to provide a systematic and harmonized approach towards promoting the mental health and well-being of teachers and educators, preventing mental disorders, facilitating care, enhancing the social and emotional wellbeing of educators, and promoting psychosocial support and recovery of those that had significant impacts and challenges.\nObjective #6: Invest in school leadership including the share of female leaders\nImportance: Quality leadership goes hand in hand with quality schools and better performance for students<sup>92</sup>. School leaders are key to create a positive school climate and culture of peace, tolerance, equity, inclusiveness, cooperation, and hard work. Quality leadership is also associated with improved teacher retention rates, higher levels of teacher job-satisfaction, increased student motivation, and reduced student drop-out rates, and parental involvement in schools among others. Unfortunately, many school leaders in Africa lack leadership skills and have not benefitted from adequate professional development. School leaders are often appointed from a pool of teachers without training to equip them with the skills they need. Gender is another concern. Female school leaders may help reduce stereotypes on women's roles in society and serve as mentors for girls. They also tend to be associated with better learning outcomes for boys and girls alike<sup>93</sup>.

Expanding early childhood education and improving foundational learning in primary school are some of the most important challenges that countries must confront. Lack of learning leads to dropout, and poor preparation for further studies even when children manage to remain in school. Early childhood education and foundational literacy and numeracy (FLN) in primary school are key to enable children to learn and engage later with the broader curriculum. FLN is also essential for the acquisition of 21<sup>st</sup> century skills. There is now a large literature on how to improve learning. Pre-primary education and early stimulation are among the strategies that can help prepare children for primary school – yet as discussed earlier, enrollment in preschools remain very low in Africa and minimum quality standards for service provision grounded in the priorities of families, communities, and governments are often lacking. In primary school, associative studies suggest that being taught in the language used at home, having a female teacher or head of school, and having a teacher who holds a professional diploma or has pre-service training are all associated with better learning while large class sizes are associated with lower performance<sup>100</sup>. Beyond associative studies, experimental or quasi-experimental studies point to cost-effective approaches to improve learning. Guidance on many of those and related issues is available in GPE discussion papers mentioned earlier<sup>101</sup>.\nGuidance: Ensuring that all children benefit from one year of pre-primary education would be a start. In addition, based on experimental or quasi-experimental studies, recommendations on how to improve learning in a cost-effective way in low- and middle-income contexts are available from the Global Education Evidence Advisory Panel convened by the World Bank and the UK Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO). The mandate of the panel was to provide succinct, usable, and policy-focused recommendations to support decision-making on education investments in low- and middle-income countries. Two reports were produced, with the second report expanding on the first. To provide guidance on what to do, and what not to do, the panel classified interventions to improve learning in the first report into four classes (great buys, good buys, promising interventions but with limited evidence, and bad buys). In the second report, a fifth class of effective but expensive interventions was added<sup>102</sup>. Effective interventions related to teachers include structured pedagogy and teaching at the right level (TaRL). Another useful resource is the Foundational Learning Pack from the Association for the Development of Education in Africa (ADEA) and Human Capital Africa (HCA)<sup>103</sup>. A range of resources are also available on the Science of Teaching website<sup>104</sup>.\nObjective #8: Invest in socio-emotional skills and education for health and well-being\nImportance: Africa today has 15 countries where attacks on education and military use of schools and universities have been recorded in 2022-2023 and is currently home to 40 million forcibly displaced persons, of which more than half are under the age of 18. Through more frequent and intense weather shocks, climate change also contributes to contexts of emergencies. Education is key to promote peace and sustainable development. In addition, a growing body of research points to the importance of socio-emotional skills or learning (SEL). Physical experiences of stress can have long term negative effects, including on student learning. Learning to manage social and emotional experiences by contrast can improve learning and well-being and improve prospects later in life. In adolescence especially, health and well-being are closely linked to the ability to remain and learn in school. For example, early pregnancies often lead girls to drop out. Violence in school, including gender-based violence, also affects both schooling and learning<sup>105</sup>. Investing in socio-emotional skills, education for health and well-being, and education for peace and sustainable development – and more broadly values, is therefore a key priority.\nGuidance: Guidance is available on how to integrate SEL in schools<sup>106</sup> and on transferable skills<sup>107</sup>.

While the purpose of education goes well beyond preparing students for the labor market, these skills matter for employment, as do digital and STEAM skills. Africa will account for most of the growth in the working-age population in coming decades with the number of youths completing upper secondary or tertiary education likely to double by 2040. Too many of these youths are likely to end up in low productivity jobs, in part because of a lack of 21<sup>st</sup> century and labor market skills, including skills related to ICT/AI and STEAM that are crucial for development. There is a clear wage premium for STEAM education in labor markets, yet scientific fields are among the areas where there is a lack of skilled manpower on the continent – and a lack of teachers and educators able to teach those subjects. As future jobs will require advanced skills, these skills must be taught, starting at a young age with attention to gender balance since girls and young women remain underrepresented in STEAM fields. Importantly, beyond what can be learned in schools, well-structured work-based training can also help. Investing in 21<sup>st</sup> century and labor market skills, including for ICT/AI and STEAM, should also help in promoting talent retention within Africa and entrepreneurship in the EdTech sector.\nGuidance: Labor market skills can encompass a wide range of domains, including so-called 21<sup>st</sup> century skills, but a special focus should be placed on ICT/AI skills and STEAM education. There is today a wealth of evidence on how to use (and not to use) ICT, which proved crucial during the COVID-19 pandemic. This evidence is summarized in the recent Global Education Monitoring Report (GEMR) on technology in education<sup>114</sup>. Guidance provided by the AU include the Digital Transformation Strategy for Africa (2020-2030)<sup>115</sup>, brief policy guidelines on digitalizing teaching and learning in Africa prepared in response to the COVID-19 pandemic<sup>116</sup>, the recent Continental Artificial Intelligence Strategy<sup>117</sup>, and the Digital Education Strategy and Implementation Plan<sup>118</sup>. On STEAM, a useful recent resource is the policy note prepared for the Africa Dialogue Series 2024 on STEAM Education for the Fourth Industrial Revolution in Africa, with a focus on generating decent jobs for Africa’s Youth<sup>119</sup> (the Dialogue Series was launched jointly by the United Nations Deputy Secretary-General and the Deputy Chairperson of the AUC). On work-based training schemes, guidance is available from the UNESCO Vocational Education (UNEVOC) network<sup>120</sup>.\nSA4: Higher Education and TVET\nObjective #10: Strengthen links between TVET and labor markets\nImportance: In a rapidly changing world of work, strengthening links between TVET and the labor markets is essential. The African Union Commission recently approved a new TVET strategy which identifies skills mismatch as a major challenge, with what is taught not meeting the demand from the labor market<sup>121</sup>, in part because a lack of involvement of employed and workers’ organizations. Other issues include weak governance and institutional capacity, inadequate financing, and a lack of quality assurance mechanisms. TVET systems are not well equipped to anticipate trends, including emerging needs for training in ICT and AI. TVET centers are concentrated in urban areas and in many fields few women enroll. There is also a lack of qualified trainers, experts, and managers, and limited opportunities for students to get on-the-job experience, including for entrepreneurship. Data on skills supply and demand is lacking to enable systems to adapt among others to digitalization, climate change, demographic shifts, and migration. A greater emphasis is also needed on lifelong learning, non-formal and informal education (including apprenticeships<sup>122</sup>), sector skills councils, recognition of prior learning, skills portability, and knowledge exchange. Finally, there is a need to place an emphasis on inclusion and vulnerable groups for secondary and higher education plus TVET.\nGuidance: It is crucial for TVET training centers to effectively utilize information from labor market analysis, curriculum reviews, graduate tracer studies, and private sector engagements to improve the relevance and delivery of the education they provide. The AU is revising its TVET strategy, with recommendations along the following dimensions: (i) Policy, governance and finance; (ii) Quality and inclusion; (iii) Partnerships, knowledge and resource sharing; and (iv) Institutional development, technology and innovation<sup>123</sup>. Useful guidance is available in a recent report by the World Bank, UNESCO, and the ILO, and a separate report by the African Development Bank and the ILO<sup>124</sup>.

Demand for higher education has been rising: this is the level of schooling in Africa with the largest growth in enrollment in proportion from the base. Growth in enrollment is expected to continue given demographic trends and gains in educational attainment at lower levels. Just 10 African countries are expected to account for three fourths of the expected global growth in the population aged 18-23 from 2015 to 2035. Yet enrollment remains below 10% of the reference age group. Many issues identified for TVET also apply to higher education, including the mismatch between the skills of graduates and the needs of the labor market. Key sectors of the economy face shortages of highly skilled workers. This includes STEAM sectors, agriculture, and energy. Lack of advanced digital skills is also a constraint, with nine in ten business leaders identifying digital skills development as a priority. Finally, access to higher education remains limited for the poor and vulnerable groups<sup>126</sup>, and for enrollment in STEAM fields and for leadership position in higher education, representation of women remains too low, constraining opportunities for future growth<sup>127</sup>.\nGuidance: While there has been less focus on higher education than basic education and TVET in the international community, guidance is available<sup>128</sup>. The AU has endorsed the Pan-African Quality Assurance and Accreditation Framework (PAQAAF) to help ensure transparency, facilitate mobility, and promote exchanges of students and staff with common standards for quality and accreditation and the recognition of degrees. A useful resource has been the Harmonization, Quality Assurance and Accreditation in African Higher Education Initiative (HAQAA). Making higher education more responsive to labor market demand, through ensuring close contact between institutions, policy makers, and private sector federations and actors, is a priority as many graduates find it difficult to obtain employment. Digitalizing higher education – including through hybrid modalities for courses, is a key issue, as is the need to promote more international collaboration, within Africa and globally. Useful lessons have been learned from approaches to encourage and fund Centers of Excellence. Another issue has been the high level of inequality in enrollment in the population (with the poor virtually unable to enroll and other vulnerable groups such as people with disabilities or forcibly displaced people with low access rates), and who manages to complete degrees in time (in many countries time to completion is too long versus the expected time for completion). Still another issue has been gender disparities, including for STEAM related fields, as already discussed. Financing of higher education remains an issue as well in Africa, as in many other parts of the world.\nObjective #12: Provide incentives for research, including in STEAM areas and in education\nImportance: Research and innovation are key for competitiveness and productivity, and thereby for economic growth<sup>129</sup>. Higher education institutions (HEIs) should conduct on-demand research to inform government policies, yet many HEIs do not have the resources needed to engage meaningfully in research and are therefore, essentially, teaching institutions. A stronger emphasis on innovation is necessary. More HEIs must become agents to promote innovation, with this effort extended to African Academies of Science. The AU’s Second Ten-Year Implementation Plan calls for producing 100,000 PhD graduates in 10 years with a target of one fifth in STEAM fields. Stronger links must be established between (1) research, innovation, and industrial development; (2) universities and research institutions in Africa and outside the continent; and (3) higher education, TVET and labor markets, as discussed in the AU’s STISA. In addition, while STEAM is a priority, for implementing CESA 26-35, research is also needed in education, including to assess what works to improve educational outcomes at all levels of education. Faculty members in Schools of Education or other Schools and Departments with an interest in education research often do not have the means to carry advanced research. They also typically do not work closely with policymakers. Research on education in Africa remains dominated today by scholars based in the Global North.

Importantly, there is a missed opportunity here in that most faculties of education throughout African universities have graduate students undertaking practitioner or action-research, but this research is not well disseminated. More broadly, data sharing between universities, CSOs, UN agencies, etc., could be strengthened.\nSA5: Second Chance Programs and Lifelong Learning\nObjective #13: Expand second chance programs for out-of-school children and youth.\nImportance: The share of children who are out of school has decreased only marginally over the last decade, with the latest data suggesting that 19.8% of children of primary school age are out of school in sub-Saharan African, down from 21.7% in 2016 (no similar aggregate data are available for northern Africa). The proportions for children of lower and upper secondary school age are even higher, at 31.1% (down from 32.2% over the same period) and 43.2% (down from 46.6%), respectively. Given population growth, the COVID-19 pandemic and associated school closures, and displacement due to conflicts and other shocks, the number of children and youth out of school has been increasing over time. These children and youth need to benefit from second-chance programs, either to enable them to return to school, or to enable them to acquire the skills they need to be successful in the labor market.\nGuidance: Accelerated learning programs are typically implemented outside of the formal schooling system. These programs should be inclusive, flexible and accredited. They help students acquire the skills needed either to re-enroll in school or obtain certificates or qualifications that are considered equivalent to what formal schooling would provide. For example, for adolescent girls who dropped out of school, accelerated learning may take place in safe spaces, with teaching of literacy, numeracy, and life skills such as self-advocacy, negotiation, and reproductive health and rights. After a certain time, the girls may be able to return to school, and continue to benefit from support while in school, noting that for young mothers, childcare facilities are also needed for school re-entry. Accelerated learning programs have also proven effective for learners whose education was interrupted due to conflict and forced displacement.

Other programs may focus on providing skills for the labor market, apart from FLN, as needed. Guidance is available on both types of programs from a variety of sources<sup>132</sup>.\nObjective #14: Expand adult literacy campaigns\nImportance: As educational attainment is increasing, albeit slowly, the youth and adult literacy rates are increasing as well, again slowly. According to UIS data, the youth literacy rate among the population aged 15-24 years increased from 87.8% in 2016 to 90.2% in the latest data available for Northern Africa. For sub-Saharan Africa, the youth literacy rate increased from 76.0% to 78.6% over the same period. The adult literacy rates (population aged 15 and above) are lower, with an increase from 71.6% to 74.6% in Northern Africa, and from 65.1% to 68.0% in sub-Saharan Africa. The benefits of literacy for youths and adults are clear, including for labor market earnings, but also in other areas. Literate adults are also better able to support the education of their children, thereby contributing to reduce high rates of learning poverty.\nGuidance: Multiple factors affecting program success must be considered when planning adult literacy campaigns. This includes the curriculum to be used (CESA 16-25 emphasized curricula rooted in African culture and values), the use of ICT and other technologies, the range of training options available to adapt to the constraints faced by adults to participate in programs, and the level of post-literacy support. Programs in the native language of learners tend to work better, as is the case for the early grades. In terms of available resources, the series of reports on Global Report on Adult Learning and Education<sup>133</sup> (ALE) provide guidance, as do the Recommendation on Adult Learning and Education<sup>134</sup>, a normative guide for ALE in which literacy is embedded. A review from a few years ago on 50 years of promoting literacy may also be useful<sup>135</sup>.

The proportions for children of lower and upper secondary school age are even higher, at 31.1% (down from 32.2% over the same period) and 43.2% (down from 46.6%), respectively. Given population growth, the COVID-19 pandemic and associated school closures, and displacement due to conflicts and other shocks, the number of children and youth out of school has been increasing over time. These children and youth need to benefit from second-chance programs, either to enable them to return to school, or to enable them to acquire the skills they need to be successful in the labor market.\n\n*Guidance:* Accelerated learning programs are typically implemented outside of the formal schooling system. These programs should be inclusive, flexible and accredited. They help students acquire the skills needed either to re-enroll in school or obtain certificates or qualifications that are considered equivalent to what formal schooling would provide. For example, for adolescent girls who dropped out of school, accelerated learning may take place in safe spaces, with teaching of literacy, numeracy, and life skills such as self-advocacy, negotiation, and reproductive health and rights. After a certain time, the girls may be able to return to school, and continue to benefit from support while in school, noting that for young mothers, childcare facilities are also needed for school re-entry. Accelerated learning programs have also proven effective for learners whose education was interrupted due to conflict and forced displacement. These programs can boost return to school, foundational skills, and improve self-advocacy and self-perception.

They suggest that in Africa, typically less than one in five adults get this opportunity. In Europe, the proportion is almost half. Lifelong learning can be provided in formal setting, but most trainings are provided in informal setting, including at work. Although the Higher Education and TVET sectors in Africa mostly provide qualifications through degrees, more could be done to provide short certifications that directly respond to individual’s (and firms’) needs. This includes approaches to certify micro-credentials and recognize prior learning<sup>138</sup>. Large firms, especially in the IT sector, provide their own micro-credential certifications. It is expected that these certifications will become increasingly important in the next decade for firms to be able to identify workers with the skills required for various positions, and for individuals to signal those skills. Lifelong learning is also key for sustainable development and climate change education.\nGuidance: At a broad level, as for adult literacy campaigns, useful references include UNESCO’s series of Global Reports on Adult Learning and Education, including the report which focuses on citizenship education<sup>139</sup>, and the ILO strategy on lifelong learning<sup>140</sup>. Five reports have been produced so far, with the last report focusing in part on citizenship education. Data and guidance are also available in recent ACQF-II Micro-credentials Survey Report<sup>141</sup>. Resources are also available on the Africa page of the UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning<sup>142</sup>. Also relevant is the call on the Greening Education Partnership for community learning centres to play a pivotal role in disseminating knowledge about sustainable practices and climate adaptation strategies.\nSA6: Gender, Equity, and Inclusion\nObjective #16: Promote gender equality in and through education\nImportance: Despite some progress, promoting gender equality in and through education remains essential for Africa’s development. As mentioned in Part I of this strategy, human capital wealth is by far the largest component of the changing wealth of nations yet is much lower than it could be because of gender differences in earnings between men and women. This is due in part to lower educational attainment for women, but more so because of differences in labor force participation and occupational segregation that are driven in part by social norms. Apart from leading to higher expected earnings in adulthood, educating girls and women has large benefits among others for reducing maternal mortality, under-five mortality and stunting, intimate partner violence, and fertility rates. Within households, women’s education is associated with better allocations of resources. Educated women also help for peace, sustainable development, and social cohesion. Finally, while a strong focus is placed in this strategy on ensuring educational opportunities for girls, in a growing number of countries, boys are the ones lagging. Preventing the exclusion and disengagement of boys from education also requires attention.\nGuidance: A wide range of resources are available to promote gender equality in and through education, including on the websites of UNESCO<sup>143</sup> and the United Nations Girls’ Education Initiative (UNGEI)<sup>144</sup>. A useful discussion is also provided by GPE<sup>145</sup>. Other recent resources include the 1<sup>st</sup> Africa Teachers Report on educating girls and ending child marriage and the role of teachers and school leaders<sup>146</sup>. On gender-responsive pedagogy (GRP), a key reference is a guide by FAWE<sup>147</sup>, for which an eLearning course was recently developed<sup>148</sup>. GRP encourages teachers, whether women or men, to adopt a gender-sensitive approach in their teaching, noting that gender identity is not necessarily a homogeneous construct.\nObjective #17: Reduce the cost of schooling\nImportance: Education should be free until the completion of secondary school. It is not free today. Many countries continue to charge for fees for secondary education or TVET, and even when publicly provided education is free, households still face a range of out-of-pocket costs. There is also an opportunity cost of schooling, especially for adolescent girls and boys. For young mothers, this includes costs from the lack of provision of childcare services to facilitate re-entry into school. These out-of-pocket and opportunity costs of schooling affect the poor disproportionately, as well as children with disabilities when assistive devices are not available, leading many of those children not to be enrolled in school at all, or to drop out of school prematurely. At the post-secondary level, very few individuals from the lower quintiles of well-being enroll. Reducing these costs could have a major impact in improving equity.\nGuidance: Multiple approaches can be used to reduce the cost of schooling. Apart from making basic education free, incentives include providing stipends or scholarships, free school uniforms, or school lunches among others. Reducing the cost of transport to school is also a useful approach when schools are more remote. Some programs provide incentives to complete a cycle, for example to prevent marriage below the age of 18. For post-secondary education including university studies, loans – possibly subsidized under proxy-means testing, are also an option. A key resource is the 1st SDG4/CESA monitoring report\n42 ▶ CONTINENTAL EDUCATION STRATEGY FOR AFRICA 2026-2035: A Framework for Action March 2025",

Data and guidance are also available in recent ACQF-II Micro-credentials Survey Report<sup>141</sup>. Resources are also available on the Africa page of the UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning<sup>142</sup>. Also relevant is the call on the Greening Education Partnership for community learning centres to play a pivotal role in disseminating knowledge about sustainable practices and climate adaptation strategies.\n\n### SA6: Gender, Equity, and Inclusion\n\n#### Objective #16: Promote gender equality in and through education\n\n*Importance:* Despite some progress, promoting gender equality in and through education remains essential for Africa’s development. As mentioned in Part I of this strategy, human capital wealth is by far the largest component of the changing wealth of nations yet is much lower than it could be because of gender differences in earnings between men and women. This is due in part to lower educational attainment for women, but more so because of differences in labor force participation and occupational segregation that are driven in part by social norms. Apart from leading to higher expected earnings in adulthood, educating girls and women has large benefits among others for reducing maternal mortality, under-five mortality and stunting, intimate partner violence, and fertility rates. Within households, women’s education is associated with better allocations of resources. Educated women also help for peace, sustainable development, and social cohesion. Finally, while a strong focus is placed in this strategy on ensuring educational opportunities for girls, in a growing number of countries, boys are the ones lagging. Preventing the exclusion and disengagement of boys from education also requires attention.\n\n*Guidance:* A wide range of resources are available to promote gender equality in and through education, including on the websites of UNESCO<sup>143</sup> and the United Nations Girls’ Education Initiative (UNGEI)<sup>144</sup>. A useful discussion is also provided by GPE<sup>145</sup>. Other recent resources include the 1<sup>st</sup> Africa Teachers Report on educating girls and ending child marriage and the role of teachers and school leaders<sup>146</sup>. On gender-responsive pedagogy (GRP), a key reference is a guide by FAWE<sup>147</sup>, for which an eLearning course was recently developed<sup>148</sup>. GRP encourages teachers, whether women or men, to adopt a gender-sensitive approach in their teaching, noting that gender identity is not necessarily a homogeneous construct.\n\n#### Objective #17: Reduce the cost of schooling\n\n*Importance:* Education should be free until the completion of secondary school. It is not free today. Many countries continue to charge for fees for secondary education or TVET, and even when publicly provided education is free, households still face a range of out-of-pocket costs. There is also an opportunity cost of schooling, especially for adolescent girls and boys. For young mothers, this includes costs from the lack of provision of childcare services to facilitate re-entry into school. These out-of-pocket and opportunity costs of schooling affect the poor disproportionately, as well as children with disabilities when assistive devices are not available, leading many of those children not to be enrolled in school at all, or to drop out of school prematurely. At the post-secondary level, very few individuals from the lower quintiles of well-being enroll. Reducing these costs could have a major impact in improving equity.\n\n*Guidance:* Multiple approaches can be used to reduce the cost of schooling. Apart from making basic education free, incentives include providing stipends or scholarships, free school uniforms, or school lunches among others. Reducing the cost of transport to school is also a useful approach when schools are more remote. Some programs provide incentives to complete a cycle, for example to prevent marriage below the age of 18. For post-secondary education including university studies, loans – possibly subsidized under proxy-means testing, are also an option. A key resource is the 1st SDG4/CESA monitoring report\n\n42 ▶ CONTINENTAL EDUCATION STRATEGY FOR AFRICA 2026-2035: A Framework for Action March 2025",

The analysis provided in the Global Education Monitoring Report on inclusion and equity remains relevant<sup>151</sup>.\nObjective #18: Ensure inclusiveness\nImportance: When inclusive education is mentioned, what typically comes to mind first is the fact that children with disabilities must be able to go to school and learn in school, ideally with other children. Disability gaps in education in Africa remain important today, in part due to lack of assistive devices. Other often excluded groups from the education system include refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs)<sup>152</sup>, children from pastoralists or nomadic groups, and those from various minority communities, whether in terms of ethnicity, religion, or other aspects of their identity. Ensuring inclusiveness is key to enable all children to go to school and learn and is also beneficial for the children already in schools.\nGuidance: All children with disabilities should be able to go to school, even if there is a cost of making this possible. Some programs to support children with disabilities are however low cost, as is the case for school eye health programs which are also relatively easy to implement<sup>153</sup>. Another resource is the United Nations’ Toolkit on Disability for Africa<sup>154</sup> and the World Bank’s inclusive education resource guide. On improving education systems for refugees, two recent reports look at evidence-based policymaking for refugee education and at a global overview of refugee education data<sup>155</sup>. More broadly, the Global Education Monitoring Report on inclusion and equity already mentioned remains relevant<sup>156</sup>.\nImplementation, Monitoring, and Evaluation\nObjective #19: Strengthen CESA Clusters and other implementation mechanisms\nImportance: As noted in the introduction, the AU does not manage large education systems or programs, in comparison to what Member States do. It also has limited staff and financial resources. The AU should “implement” CESA 26-35, but what implementation means is different from what is traditionally understood with a strategy. The aim of CESA 26-35 is to provide guidance for others (Member States especially) to implement, acknowledging the need to adapt the interventions proposed to the budgetary, administrative, political, and socio-cultural context of Member States. Furthermore, this context and the evidence can and will change, especially over a decade which is the time horizon for CESA 26-35. Implementation then should refer at least in part to keeping CESA guidance up to date and deepening the guidance as more evidence of what works to improve educational outcomes becomes available. This should be one of the key roles of CESA clusters, a mechanism that has proven useful for information exchange, the generation of new evidence, and the mobilization of stakeholders, but needs strengthening.\nGuidance: The CESA 16-25 suggests that functioning clusters are appreciated by their members (and by the AU), but the performance of clusters has been mixed. The clusters should have autonomy in their work, but they should also be held accountable, including in terms of the roles played by cluster leaders. When clusters are not fulfilling their role or become inactive, which is at the time of writing the case for about half of the clusters, steps should be undertaken to engage the leadership and possibly replace leaders if the current leadership is not sufficiently committed. Clusters should be mandated to submit an annual report on their activities, which some clusters do not at present do. Finding ways to support clusters in resource mobilization is also paramount, as this emerges clearly from the CESA 16-25 review as a constraint to their effectiveness. Ensuring more collaboration between clusters is also a priority, to reap the full benefit from potential synergies. Better communications by clusters could also increase impact.\nObjective #20: Streamline monitoring and evaluation\nImportance: What gets measured gets done, the adage goes. Without M&E, accountability for implementation is weakened. Lack of M&E also does not permit realignment of priorities as needed. But M&E needs to be based on a framework that can be implemented considering limitations in data collection. There must also be consensus on the indicators to be used, which is easier if indicators used to assess progress towards the objectives of the strategy are already agreed upon for monitoring SDG4. New indicators could be proposed, but after a feasibility study would confirm that they can be collected. In general, it is often better to focus on a few key indicators than try to spread the net too wide.\nGuidance: As mentioned in the CESA 16-25 review, at the Pan-African Conference on Education (PACE) in 2018 Member States requested the AU’s Pan-African Institute for Education for Development (AU/IPED) and UIS to establish a joint monitoring and reporting mechanism for the CESA and SDG 4 frameworks<sup>157</sup>. Three reports have been published: (i) A report comparing the CESA and SDG 4 frameworks<sup>158</sup>; (ii) A report<sup>159</sup> with an overview of the mapping exercise’s conclusions, highlighting indicators available in the UIS global database and others for which measurement methodologies were to be developed; and (iii) A Mid-term Review (MTR) assessment<sup>160</sup> of the monitoring framework for CESA 16-25 published in July\nMarch 2025 | CONTINENTAL EDUCATION STRATEGY FOR AFRICA 2026-2035: A Framework for Action | 43",

While CESA 16-25 benefited from a good level of awareness among respondents to online surveys and was perceived as both relevant and useful, its impact in countries was limited, as was its use to inform stakeholder policies and programs. CESA 16-25 included a description of the role of various stakeholders in implementing the strategy. It envisioned engaging the \"widest possible coalition for education, training and STI in Africa.\" The monitoring mechanism was meant to have at its top a team of ten Heads of State and governments who would champion the strategy. Specific roles were assigned to Member States, regional economic communities, and other stakeholders. The need for data collection and analysis to inform decision-making was mentioned, as was the need for action plans and regular reporting. Finally, CESA clusters were created to share initiatives and experiences along thematic lines. In practice however, governance, communications, and monitoring frameworks suffered from limited implementation. Operational plans were not drafted or completed, reporting on outcomes was weak, and the cluster mechanism, while beneficial, did not achieve its full potential.

They are encouraged to implement pilot projects under CESA 26-35 and should have representation on a rotating basis in the CESA Operational Committee.\nCESA clusters: CESA clusters, which proved to be useful as an implementation mechanism, should be strengthened. The cluster mechanism is a useful way to federate African Union education partners by areas of focus and expertise. Clusters mostly function today as a way of sharing information and organizing events, but they could play a larger role, including to provide more detailed guidance to RECs and member states in their area of expertise. Beyond serving as a mechanism for information exchange, clusters should support the generation of new evidence and the mobilization of stakeholders. They need autonomy in their work but should also be held accountable. If clusters are not fulfilling their role or become inactive, their leadership should be renewed. They should be encouraged to mobilize resources, as this is a constraint to effectiveness. Ensuring collaboration between clusters should also be a priority to reap benefits from synergies.\nInternational and continental partners: This category covers a broad range of stakeholders.

Clusters mostly function today as a way of sharing information and organizing events, but they could play a larger role, including to provide more detailed guidance to RECs and member states in their area of expertise. Beyond serving as a mechanism for information exchange, clusters should support the generation of new evidence and the mobilization of stakeholders. They need autonomy in their work but should also be held accountable. If clusters are not fulfilling their role or become inactive, their leadership should be renewed. They should be encouraged to mobilize resources, as this is a constraint to effectiveness. Ensuring collaboration between clusters should also be a priority to reap benefits from synergies.",

The framework should include at the minimum the indicators that will be monitored to access progress. It could also, if useful, provide tentative targets and an assessment of the cost of reaching targets, although this would require detailed analytical work. Every year, AU/ESTI should produce a brief annual report on progress towards CESA implementation. A more detailed biennial or triennial report would be discussed at CESA conferences. The AU/ESTI Department should also draft implementation action plans and update these plans as needed based on feedback from RECs, Members States, and other stakeholders. A mid-term review should take place in 2029 or 2030. The timing of this review would coincide with the horizon for the SDGs, so that CESA 26-35 could be adapted for the second half of the decade to the new framework that would be adopted post-SDGs. Upon completion of the decade, a final evaluation should take place to assess the strategy’s outcomes and impact. On monitoring, apart from assessing progress towards CESA 26-35 objectives, it will be important to assess if and how the strategy proves useful to RECs, Member States, and other stakeholders in drafting their own sector plans, policies, and regulatory frameworks.\nOn indicators for monitoring, building on the discussion of the monitoring framework for CESA 16-25 in the CESA 16-25 Review, simple recommendations can be made. The CESA 16-25 monitoring framework proved too complex for implementation. The monitoring framework for CESA 26-35 should have a streamlined list of indicators with a focus on indicators already available under SDG4 monitoring or that could reasonably be developed and measured in enough countries, possibly building on already agreed upon initiatives such as those following the Transforming Education Summit. The good news is that data are available for many of the objectives outlined in the strategy, as explained below (in the discussion below, some suggested indicators should clearly be part of the monitoring framework for CESA 26-35, but others are more tentative and would require further discussion before potential adoption).\nObjective #1: Data are available on public expenditure on education as a percentage of total government expenditure and public expenditure on education as a percentage of GDP. In some countries, data on public current expenditure by education level are also available, which is useful to assess and equity in public spending especially when combined with a benefit incidence analysis on who enrolls in public education at various levels. In addition, various initiatives aim to collect data on education policies, including UNESCO’s Profiles Enhancing Education Reviews (PEER)<sup>162</sup>. Another example of effort to analyze country policies is the World Bank’s Education Policy Dashboard. The Dashboard is comprehensive, but data are available only for a handful of countries.\nObjective #2: Available data are limited to measure progress in upgrading curricula. As part of its monitoring for SDG4, UIS collects data on the extent to which (i) global citizenship education and (ii) education for sustainable development are mainstreamed in teacher education. But data on upgrading curricula in other areas remain scarce, although experience shows that such data can be collected if resources are available to do so<sup>163</sup>. Still, substantial effort would be needed to develop and measure appropriate indicators to be able to measure progress for this objective.\nObjective #3: Estimates across countries of gaps in the number of schools or TTIs and universities needed to serve the population are not available, but data are available on the coverage of basic infrastructure services in schools, especially access to basic drinking water, single-sex sanitation facilities, basic handwashing facilities, and electricity. For girls’ education, adequate WASH (Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene) infrastructure is crucial, with data from the Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) useful to monitor progress<sup>164</sup>. Data are also available for some countries on menstrual health for girls (facilities, knowledge, and materials). Finally, data are available on access to computers and the internet for pedagogical purposes in primary and secondary schools, even if in sub-Saharan Africa coverage remains currently limited.\nObjective #4: UIS collects data on several indicators related to teachers for SDG4 reporting. The indicator with the best country coverage is the proportion of teachers with the required minimum qualifications according to national standards. Other indicators include (1) the extent to which (i) global citizenship education and (ii) education for sustainable development are mainstreamed in teacher education (as mentioned above when discussing objective #2); (2) the average teacher salary relative to other professions requiring a comparable level of qualification; and (3) the percentage of teachers in lower secondary education who received in-service training in the last 12 months by type of training. Yet the coverage of those indicators is patchy in Africa. Efforts could\n48 ▶ CONTINENTAL EDUCATION STRATEGY FOR AFRICA 2026-2035: A Framework for Action March 2025",

In some countries, data on public current expenditure by education level are also available, which is useful to assess and equity in public spending especially when combined with a benefit incidence analysis on who enrolls in public education at various levels. In addition, various initiatives aim to collect data on education policies, including UNESCO’s Profiles Enhancing Education Reviews (PEER)<sup>162</sup>. Another example of effort to analyze country policies is the World Bank’s Education Policy Dashboard. The Dashboard is comprehensive, but data are available only for a handful of countries.\n\n**Objective #2:** Available data are limited to measure progress in upgrading curricula. As part of its monitoring for SDG4, UIS collects data on the extent to which (i) global citizenship education and (ii) education for sustainable development are mainstreamed in teacher education. But data on upgrading curricula in other areas remain scarce, although experience shows that such data can be collected if resources are available to do so<sup>163</sup>. Still, substantial effort would be needed to develop and measure appropriate indicators to be able to measure progress for this objective.\n\n**Objective #3:** Estimates across countries of gaps in the number of schools or TTIs and universities needed to serve the population are not available, but data are available on the coverage of basic infrastructure services in schools, especially access to basic drinking water, single-sex sanitation facilities, basic handwashing facilities, and electricity. For girls’ education, adequate WASH (Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene) infrastructure is crucial, with data from the Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) useful to monitor progress<sup>164</sup>. Data are also available for some countries on menstrual health for girls (facilities, knowledge, and materials). Finally, data are available on access to computers and the internet for pedagogical purposes in primary and secondary schools, even if in sub-Saharan Africa coverage remains currently limited.\n\n**Objective #4:** UIS collects data on several indicators related to teachers for SDG4 reporting. The indicator with the best country coverage is the proportion of teachers with the required minimum qualifications according to national standards. Other indicators include (1) the extent to which (i) global citizenship education and (ii) education for sustainable development are mainstreamed in teacher education (as mentioned above when discussing objective #2); (2) the average teacher salary relative to other professions requiring a comparable level of qualification; and (3) the percentage of teachers in lower secondary education who received in-service training in the last 12 months by type of training. Yet the coverage of those indicators is patchy in Africa. Efforts could\n\n48 ▶ CONTINENTAL EDUCATION STRATEGY FOR AFRICA 2026-2035: A Framework for Action March 2025",

Measures of the deployment of teachers to rural and remote areas could also be designed using EMIS data.\nObjective #5: As just mentioned, UIS collects data on the average teacher salary relative to other professions requiring a comparable level of qualification, but coverage is patchy. Household and labor force surveys can however be used for this purpose, given that when respondents are asked about their occupation, the surveys often include a response modality for teachers. This can be used to assess not only wage levels, but also other benefits and working hours. The surveys also provide information on the education of teachers which can be compared to EMIS data. Finally, surveys with consumption modules can be used to estimate the share of teachers in poverty.\nObjective #6: Systematic cross-country data on school leadership are lacking. Given the importance of leadership for educational outcomes, this is an important area for investment. Data can be provided among others from EMIS data and household surveys, at least when surveys identify school leaders (this is the case for surveys implemented in nine West African countries by the World Bank with the West Africa Economic and Monetary Union). Data on the type of training received by school leaders would also be beneficial, including to showcase innovative approaches. Although this may be more difficult to measure in a systematic way, indicators to identify, develop, validate and promote innovations initiated by teachers, principals, inspectors would be useful.\nObjective #7: For enrollment in pre-primary education, estimates are reported by countries to UIS. UIS also collects data on the share of students in Grade 2 or 3 and at the end of primary school that reach minimum proficiency in math and reading. These estimates are based in part on international student assessments such as PASEC and SEACMEQ. Those datasets have also been used to provide estimates of harmonized learning outcomes across countries, learning poverty, and learning-adjusted years of schooling. This last measure combines the number of years of schooling that students are expected to complete with the amount of learning that takes place in school according to harmonized learning outcomes. On constraints to schooling and learning, household surveys can be used to monitor who enrolls in basic education, and what the out-of-pocket cost of enrolling for parents is. Many surveys also provide information on factors leading children to drop out of school, and whether parents are satisfied with schools or if not, why not. Finally, new modules in MICS surveys are also useful to assess foundational learning.\nObjective #8: Data are currently not systematically available to measure SEL, but tools are being developed. On health and well-being, school-based surveys are available, including (1) the Global School Health Survey (GSHS) which includes mostly low- and middle-income countries (the latest GSHS surveys date back from a decade, but a new round of surveys is being implemented with support from UNESCO's O3 program); (2) the Health Behavior in School-Age Children survey (HBSC) which includes mostly European countries as well as Canada and a few countries from North Africa and the Middle East; and (3) and the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) which includes mostly middle and high income countries, such as South Africa (more data may become available in the future through the PISA for development program). Other surveys are implemented in the overall population, including the Violence against Children Survey (VACS) and the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), both of which have been implemented in many African countries. On perceptions of conflict and violence, data are available in the Afrobarometer, although not specifically for education. But the Afrobarometer can be used to assess difficulties in obtaining education services and levels of petty corruption in education and other services<sup>165</sup>.\nObjective #9: Systematic data across countries are limited on whether youths acquire the skills they need for the labor market, but some data are available. At the school level, as mentioned above, information is available on access to computers and the internet for pedagogical purposes. For teachers, EMIS data often provide information on the types of trainings that teachers have undertaken, including for digital skills, and some internationally comparable student assessment data also provide that information. Household surveys also now commonly include module asking individuals about ICT skills. UIS maintains data on enrollment in STEAM fields in higher education.\nObjective #10: Data are maintained by UIS and the ILO on several indicators that relate to TVET and youth employment. This includes: (1) The share of students in secondary education enrolled in TVET; and (2) the share of youths and adults who participated in a formal and non-formal education and training over the past 12 months; and (3) The unemployment rates for individuals aged 15-25, including by education level. Additional indicators are discussed in the World Bank, UNESCO, and the ILO report mentioned above. Labor force and especially enterprise surveys can be used to assess the demand for skills in the labor market.

UIS also collects data on the share of students in Grade 2 or 3 and at the end of primary school that reach minimum proficiency in math and reading. These estimates are based in part on international student assessments such as PASEC and SEACMEQ. Those datasets have also been used to provide estimates of harmonized learning outcomes across countries, learning poverty, and learning-adjusted years of schooling. This last measure combines the number of years of schooling that students are expected to complete with the amount of learning that takes place in school according to harmonized learning outcomes. On constraints to schooling and learning, household surveys can be used to monitor who enrolls in basic education, and what the out-of-pocket cost of enrolling for parents is. Many surveys also provide information on factors leading children to drop out of school, and whether parents are satisfied with schools or if not, why not. Finally, new modules in MICS surveys are also useful to assess foundational learning.",

Data are also available, at least in some countries, on the type of subject studied, including STEAM. Data are also available on other broader indicators, such as the share of GDP invested by countries in research and development (R&D). Household surveys can also be used to monitor who enrolls in higher education and out-of-pocket costs of doing so. As for TVET, labor force and enterprise surveys can be used to assess demand for graduates in the labor market and at the level of HEIs, it is a good practice to implement tracer surveys of graduates to assess labor outcomes for graduates and their feedback on the education they received. Regional initiatives to develop EMIS, including for higher education, should be supported (examples from EAC and SADC exist, and the HAQAA3 initiative for regional higher education data also provides some useful insights).\nObjective #12: Various types of data are available on research and innovation, the share of patents being registered in Africa, staffing in HEIs from national research and higher education databases, African Centers of Excellence established under various initiatives, and initiatives and projects to support competency frameworks for researchers and quality assessment of doctoral schools, doctoral studies, and research. While rankings of higher education institutions are problematic, some of the data these rankings rely on can also be useful. For research specifically in education, especially for empirical assessments of what works to improve educational outcomes, useful databases include the 3ie Development Evidence Portal (DEP)<sup>166</sup>, a repository of rigorous evidence on what works in international development, including in education. Also useful is the African Education Research Database<sup>167</sup> hosted by the Faculty of Education at the University of Cambridge which collates research by African scholars on education. These databases might be used to track research trends over time.

Information is also available in many countries, typically from survey data, on young people not in employment, education or training (NEET). Data are however not available across countries on the number of children and youth who benefit from second chance programs, in part because apart from Ministries of Education or other public agencies, many CSOs provide such programs.\nObjective #14: Data are maintained by UIS on the youth and adult literacy rates. Additional data on literacy can be collected from a range of sources, including household surveys (for example, many Demographic and Health Surveys have questions whereby respondents are asked to read a sentence). Data on adult literacy campaigns or public education expenditure on adult literacy are however not available in a systematic way across countries.\nObjective #15: As noted when discussing TVET, indicators reported by UIS include the share of youths and adults who participated in a formal and non-formal education and training over the past 12 months. On micro-credentials, the latest ACQF-II survey collected data on trends in micro-credentials 28 countries. This is an area where more data may become available in the future.\nObjective #16: Data are available since UIS reports estimates of enrollment and completion rates by gender. Data on minimum proficiency in math and reading are also reported by gender. Data tend to be more available however for sub-Saharan Africa than for northern Africa. On gender inequality in earnings, data are regularly available from various sources, including the ILO, the World Economic Forum (WEF), and the World Bank. Another useful database is on legal aspects, including for topics such as child marriage, from the Women, Business and the Law program at the World Bank.

Apart from lack of data for many indicators in the monitoring framework, AAs were meant to be the basis for operational plans that were not drafted.

The mid-term review (MTR) of the M&E framework was long delayed and published only in July 2024 with a limited scope for analysis.

As discussed in the CESA 16-25 Review, monitoring of that strategy was weak with the mid-term report published only in July 2024. At the same time, building blocks were created that should strengthen monitoring for CESA 26-35. Following the Pan-African Conference on Education (PACE) in Nairobi, UIS and AU/IPED have been charged to enhance data reporting in the continent. Recent developments such as the UIS LASER Initiative may help creating a more efficient system for data collection, analysis, and use. EMIS systems have been strengthened in countries with support from the Knowledge and Innovation Exchange (KIX) program. Initiatives such as UNICEF’s Data Must Speak have shown how EMIS data could help inform decision-making and strengthen accountability, while GPE’s Data Roundtable has promoted broader discussions on the future of education data.

Beyond what could be monitored across countries under CESA 26-35, countries should set up their own monitoring mechanisms, enabling them to assess the extent to which the policies they adopt are being implemented and are achieving their objectives. In this context, EMIS 2.0 refers to a number of recent development in improving EMIS data, including (i) Shifting beyond aggregate data to individual learner data to track student progress, identify learning gaps, and tailor interventions to meet each child’s needs; (ii) Positioning EMIS for equity and learning by collecting data to identify disparities related to socioeconomic status, disability, or geographic location, and integrating data on students’ home environments, parental involvement, and poverty levels to inform targeted interventions; (iii) Empowering school management committees and Parent-Teacher Associations to use EMIS data, enabling them to engage with schools directly for citizen engagement and social accountability; and (iv) Decentralizing data management, thereby increasing responsiveness and relevance at the local level.

To change direction, beyond strategic vision, careful planning will be needed. Education systems in Africa and globally face headwinds. Funding and other resources are limited. Challenges abound, not only within education systems but also externally with conflicts and climate change being just two examples of external threats. Implications of the fourth industrial revolution for education systems, including the roles to be played by digitalization and AI, are only starting to be understood. Investing in education is one of the best investments countries can make, but to steer a tanker through challenging waters, beyond strategic vision implementation is key. Two points will require special attention. First, as already mentioned, the guidance given in this strategy will need to be adapted over time and across space considering the diversity of Member States the AU serves and their changing needs. Second, implementation will take place in a context in which many African (and non-African) countries face high levels of debt and constrained budgets. Assessing both needs and the cost-effectiveness of alternative interventions to meet these needs based on national and local contexts will be essential to maximize the benefits from investments in education. To transform their education systems, Member States and stakeholders including RECs will need to do more and better with limited resources. This will require prioritization. In the end, this strategy will be useful to the extent that its guidance helps inform domestic policy in Member States, including through Education Sector Planning and Compact Development. For CESA 26-35 to fulfill this role, resource mobilization and adequate implementation will be essential.",

(2023) on program characteristics and Harris-Van Keuren (2023) on costs. For literacy, 10 characteristics of successful programs were identified: the programs focus on training teachers in modeling and practicing new skills, include structured teachers' guides, have coaches providing structured tools to support teachers, use face-to-face training methods for the initial trainings, use direct-instruction pedagogical methods, ensure that student books are available at a 1:1 ratio for all students, use a phonics-based instructional methodology, increase the amount of instructional time in reading lessons, build capacity at a decentralized level, and are designed to align with existing government education plans. For numeracy, 14 characteristics of successful programs were identified: the programs include learning aids for students (e.g., counters, number cards, etc.), have materials aligned to the curriculum, use structured teacher's guides (scripted lessons), include continuous and formative assessment, target instruction to the student level (differentiated instruction or teaching at the right level), focus on developing conceptual understanding, include pair or group work, use concrete materials and resources (manipulatives), rely on coaches who are government staff, include an initial face-to-face training as well as refresher face-to-face training, have teacher training (lowest level in cascade) done by government officers, have Government staff responsible for conducting monitoring, and invest in building capacity at the decentralized level.\n<sup>89</sup> UNESCO and International Task Force on Teachers for Education 2030 (2024).\n<sup>90</sup> On teacher awards, see the short guidance by Hungi and Wodon (2024).\n<sup>91</sup> African Union Commission (2025a).\n<sup>92</sup> The importance of school leaders has long been noted (Leithwood et al., 2004), but it has been confirmed by more recent work. Unfortunately, many school leaders in Africa lack leadership skills and have not benefitted from professional development to guide their work.\n<sup>93</sup> Several explanations could be advanced for the positive effect of female teachers and school leaders on learning outcomes (Wodon et al., 2024a). Female teachers are less likely than male teachers to have a second job, possibly because of responsibilities at home. This may enable them to concentrate more on their teaching. They are also less likely to be poor, possibly because they married individuals with better earnings opportunities given their own social status. Not having to confront the daily pressures and uncertainty associated with poverty may again enable female teachers to concentrate more fully on their job. See also Bergmann et al. (2022).\n<sup>94</sup> This leads to lower attrition rates which matters especially given current teacher shortages (UNESCO and International Teacher Task Force on Teachers for Education 2030, 2024).\n<sup>95</sup> Nwokeocha et al.

(2022, 2024).\n<sup>99</sup> World Bank et al. (2022).
