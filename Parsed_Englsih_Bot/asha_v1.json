This could be the victim’s home, a friend’s home or with a family member.\n* Be supportive and reassure her that it is not her fault. Treat her with kindness and understanding.\n* Find out from her if she could identify the person who raped her, the circumstances under which it happened and the extent of her injuries.\n* It is vital for the woman to receive medical attention, and strongly recommended for her to receive a forensic examination. You should also accompany the woman to the healthcare facility.\n* Preserving the evidence (biological material left on the victim’s body) is important to identify the perpetrator in a sexual assault case, especially those in which the offender is a stranger. Thus the woman should not bathe or clean up before the examination.\n* Support the woman and family members in seeking help from police and enable them to contact other organizations working in the community to support the woman who has been raped.\n* Even if the victim has not yet decided to report the crime, receiving a forensic medical exam and keeping the evidence safe will improve the chances that the police can access and test the evidence later.\n* Give her emergency contraceptive pills to prevent pregnancy. Immediate hospitalization is needed if injuries are severe.\n* Help the woman tell her family members in case she has not already told. Remember that family members also need to overcome their feelings about rape.\n* Tell the woman and family members that although the incident is devastating, one must try and move on, and that this incident is not the end of everything.\n* The woman may need special psychological counselling and should be supported for referral to a district hospital.",
