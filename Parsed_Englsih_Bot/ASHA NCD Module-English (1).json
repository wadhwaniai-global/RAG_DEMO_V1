But now, we face another set of health\nchallenges. You must have heard in your community that people complain of having high\nblood pressure or high blood sugar or suffering from cancers.\n\nThese complaints are heard across the country. More and more people are affected by\ndiseases like heart attacks and stroke, cancer, asthma and breathing difﬁculty, mental\ndisorder injuries, kidney, liver and other problems. These diseases are called Non-\nCommunicable Diseases (NCDs).\n\nThis module will tell you more about these NCDs.

Some NCDs progress slowly or cause chronic symptoms\nrequiring long term care and control while others progress rapidly. They affect adult men\nand women but children are vulnerable as well. People may appear healthy but still suffer\nfrom these conditions.\n\nOne of the most serious concerns about NCDs is that they affect people in the productive\nyears of their life. They also cause “premature deaths” - that is, a death occurring before\nthe average life expectancy.

This can cause the vessel to become narrow or blocked and\nreduce the blood flow. This leads to a heart attack.\n\nWarning signs\n\nl□        Pain, pressure or constriction in the centre of the chest for more than 30 minutes.\n\nl□        Nausea.\n\nl□        Unconsciousness.\n\nl□        Pain in jaw, neck, arms, shoulders or back.\n\nl□        Shortness of breath.\n\nStroke\n\nStroke is deﬁned as paralysis or numbness of one side of the body. It can also cause,\ndifﬁculty of speech, hearing, reading or writing. Stroke is due to a lack of blood supply to\nthe brain.

Insert the lancet. Take the sealing cap off the needle. Do not touch the needle. Close\n       the device. Set the spring of the device so that it is ready to use by pressing or pulling\n       the load button on the lancet device.\n\n6.     Clean the ﬁngertip of the subject prior to needle prick.\n\n7.     Turn on the glucometer and place a test strip in the machine when the machine\n       is ready. One end will need to face the top of the glucometer; usually it has a dark\n       coloured line on it. This is where the blood will be placed for testing. Watch the\n       indicator for indication to place a blood drop onto the strip.\n\n8.     Use a lancet to prick the side or top of the ﬁnger to get small amount of blood. Let the\n       blood flow freely from the ﬁngertip; do not squeeze the ﬁnger. Squeezing the ﬁnger\n       can affect the results. Rubbing/Milking your ﬁnger before pricking it helps in easy\n       availability of a blood droplet for the meter.\n\n9.     Place the drop of blood on the test strip. The blood drop is to be placed against the edge\n       or top of the strip. Wipe away the ﬁrst drop of blood because it may be contaminated\n       with tissue fluid or debris.\n\n10. Apply cotton ball to subject’s ﬁnger and hold ﬁrmly until bleeding stops.\n\n11. Watch the glucometer screen. It should show a “waiting” or “processing” symbol, and\n       will produce a beep when the sample has been tested. The results will be displayed as\n       a number on the screen.\n\n12. Note the reading in the notebook or family folder of the subject. Keeping a record\n       will make it easier to identify the subjects who need referral, and for the doctor to\n       establish a good treatment plan.\n\n13. Turn the glucometer off.\n\n14. Place the used needle device into the sharps bin immediately.\n\n15. Dispose of test strip into clinical waste bin before removing gloves.\n\n16. If sharp bin and clinical waste bin are not available; then use two separate boxes\n       to store the sharp disposal and clinical waste products separately. After the blood\n       glucose test; these boxes need to be transferred to bio-hazard container. Always wear\n       gloves before transferring the bio-hazard products. (be alert to avoid needle pricks).\n\n17. Use an alcohol based wipe to clean the meter ensuring all external surfaces are clean.\n\n18. If the reading is high, then the individual should be referred to a medical professional\n       for check-up.\n\n\nDiabetes |  37",

Also, if somebody says\n“no” in response to a question it does not mean that they do not have the disease. The\nimportant thing for you to remember is that everybody (of 30 years and above) must be\nscreened.
