If yes, reassure her / refer her to the nearest health facility.\n\n2. **A client coming for next dose within the grace period (upto 2 weeks earlier or 4 weeks later from the scheduled date):**\n\n* Counsel the client on the importance of taking the subsequent injections on the scheduled date (as per the date given on the MPA client card). Remember that if the client has come two weeks earlier/ four weeks later than the scheduled date, the date of next injection would be calculated as exact three months from last dose.\n* Discuss the alarming signs (like prolonged or heavy bleeding which doesn't subside within few weeks) again and tell her when to report to the health facility.\n* Discuss if she has any side effects. If yes, reassure her or refer her to the nearest health facility.\n* In case the woman does not want to continue with the method, help her to choose another method.\n\n",

A client coming after the grace period/ not returning for subsequent dose:\n   Counsel the client on the importance of taking the subsequent injections on the scheduled date\n   (the client would be considered as a new client if she comes after the grace period).\n  Discuss the reasons for not returning on time for subsequent doses.\n  Discuss if she has any side effects. Ifyes, reassure her or refer her to the nearest health facility\n  In case the woman does not want to continue with the method, help her to choose another method.\n\nRole of ASHA:\n  Maintain the list of women who opt for MPA as a contraceptive option.\n   Discuss the importance of follow up visits with the clients and remind them just before the due date,\n  to go to the facility.\n     Visit women taking MPA injection at least once a month to discuss her experiences with the method\n   and reassure her regarding her concerns. If she is very concerned about side effects, motivate her to\n   consult the ANM or the doctor who has given the injection.\n         One concern that women may have is related to the changes in the menstrual cycle. These include\n           irregular or heavy bleeding. Some women may complain that their monthly bleeding has stopped.\n      Tell them that these changes are normal. She needs to be told that the periods may completely stop\n   because that is the way the method works and is not harmful. Reassure the woman that the menstrual\n   cycle will restart when they decide they want to get pregnant again and discontinue the contraceptive.\n\n            It may be explained in the following way to the client, \"Every month a woman's body\n         prepares for conception. An egg is released and uterus also prepares to nurture the baby.\n        Hence inner lining of the uterus becomes thick and soft as it gets more blood supply. If she\n           does not conceive that month, this inner lining of blood is thrown out of her body as\n           menstrual flow. This is repeated every month, causing menstrual cycles. With MPA, the\n          monthly preparation for pregnancy in woman's body does not occur. There is no release of\n         egg or thickening of inner lining of uterus. The menstrual cycle gradually comes to a stop\n       after irregular bleeding for some time.'                                         99\n\nCENTCHROMAN - WEEKLY PILLS\n\nThe second contraceptive that you will learn about in this update is Centchroman (Chhaya pills)\n    Centchroman is an oral contraceptive pill which does not contain any hormone.

      "md": "\n### 3. A client coming after the grace period/ not returning for subsequent dose:\n* Counsel the client on the importance of taking the subsequent injections on the scheduled date (the client would be considered as a new client if she comes after the grace period).\n* Discuss the reasons for not returning on time for subsequent doses.\n* Discuss if she has any side effects. If yes, reassure her or refer her to the nearest health facility.\n* In case the woman does not want to continue with the method, help her to choose another method.\n\n#### Role of ASHA:\n* Maintain the list of women who opt for MPA as a contraceptive option.\n* Discuss the importance of follow up visits with the clients and remind them just before the due date, to go to the facility.\n* Visit women taking MPA injection at least once a month to discuss her experiences with the method and reassure her regarding her concerns. If she is very concerned about side effects, motivate her to consult the ANM or the doctor who has given the injection.\n* One concern that women may have is related to the changes in the menstrual cycle. These include irregular or heavy bleeding. Some women may complain that their monthly bleeding has stopped. Tell them that these changes are normal. She needs to be told that the periods may completely stop because that is the way the method works and is not harmful. Reassure the woman that the menstrual cycle will restart when they decide they want to get pregnant again and discontinue the contraceptive.\n\n> It may be explained in the following way to the client, “Every month a woman’s body prepares for conception. An egg is released and uterus also prepares to nurture the baby. Hence inner lining of the uterus becomes thick and soft as it gets more blood supply. If she does not conceive that month, this inner lining of blood is thrown out of her body as menstrual flow. This is repeated every month, causing menstrual cycles. With MPA, the monthly preparation for pregnancy in woman’s body does not occur. There is no release of egg or thickening of inner lining of uterus. The menstrual cycle gradually comes to a stop after irregular bleeding for some time.”\n\n## CENTCHROMAN - WEEKLY PILLS\n\nThe second contraceptive that you will learn about in this update is Centchroman (Chhaya pills).\n\n**Centchroman** is an oral contraceptive pill which does not contain any hormone.

It would also be a part of your ASHA kit, so you may distribute to the clients using it. The first dose can be provided only after proper screening at a health facility by a trained provider (Doctor, CHO, SN, LHV, ANM).\n\n# Schedule:\n\nCentchroman (Chhaya) is to be taken twice a week for the first 3 months and once a week from 4th month onwards.\n\n# To begin the use of Chhaya, the woman is advised to take the first pill on the first day of period (which is the first day of bleeding) and the second pill three days later (on 4th day of bleeding). This pattern of days are repeated through the first 3 months.\n\nStarting from the fourth month, the pills is to be taken once a week on the first pill day and should be continued on the weekly schedule regardless of other menstrual cycle.\n\n## Table: Schedule of Centchroman\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>In the first day of pill is taken on</th>\n<th>First 3 months</th>\n<th>After 3 months</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Sunday</td>\n<td>Sunday and Wednesday</td>\n<td>Sunday</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Monday</td>\n<td>Monday and Thursday</td>\n<td>Monday</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tuesday</td>\n<td>Tuesday and Friday</td>\n<td>Tuesday</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wednesday</td>\n<td>Wednesday and Saturday</td>\n<td>Wednesday</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Thursday</td>\n<td>Thursday and Sunday</td>\n<td>Thursday</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Friday</td>\n<td>Friday and Monday</td>\n<td>Friday</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Saturday</td>\n<td>Saturday and Tuesday</td>\n<td>Saturday</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n# What should be suggested to clients in case of missed pills?\n\nYou should tell the woman, that if she forgets to take the pill, she should take the missed pill as soon as she remembers that it has been missed. If she misses taking the tablet by 1-2 days (less than 7 days), she should take the missed pill as soon as she remembers and continue the normal schedule.
