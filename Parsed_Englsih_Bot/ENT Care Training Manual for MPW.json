ACUTE TONSILLITIS\n\n      Tonsils are a pair of special tissues situated at the back of the throat.

The cough is rare\nand dry. They do not have pain, but their voice can\nget hoarse.\nThere are many causes of irritation – it can be due to bacteria or viral germs. It could also be because\nof allergies to dust. Many times, it is due to gastric acidity which causes reflux into the throat.\nHow to Reduce Irritation That Triggers Coughing:\n1.     Drink lots of fluids: The most important thing you can do is to drink plenty of water to reduce\n       dryness of your throat. Drink at least 1 and a half litre of water each day, that is about 6-8\n       glasses of water. Avoid tea, coffee, or soft drinks as they usually contain caffeine..\n2.     Breathing:\n       a.     Sit and stand in good posture – that is, neck and back straight and your chin gently tucked\n              in. This opens your airway, makes breathing easier and allows you to relax the throat.\n       b.     Avoid bad posture. When you sit or stand in a lazy posture your shoulders tilt forward and\n              your head tilts back and your chin lifts slightly. This puts pressure on your throat, vocal\n              cords, and neck. It can increase irritation and put strain on your voice.\n       c.     Breathe through your nose. Mouth breathing dries your throat. Breathing through your nose\n              cleans, warms, and moistens the air before it reaches your throat and vocal cords..\n3.     Talking:\n       a.     Limit harmful voice use, such as shouting, grunting, or screaming. Talking, laughing, or\n              singing too loudly can also damage your vocal cords.\n       b.     Try not to speak over other noise such as television or music or around machinery such as\n              a lawnmower.\n       c.     Do not whisper, as whispering increases air pressure in your vocal cords and may irritate\n              your throat.\n       d.     Use your natural voice, not too high, not too low, and not too loud.\n       e.     Limit coughing and clearing your throat. Sometimes coughing can be excessive and\n              clearing the throat can become a habit. When you cough and clear your throat it puts too\n              much force on your throat and vocal cords.\n4.     Everyday\n       a.     Avoid chewing tobacco/paan/gutka, smoking cigarette/bidi etc.\n       b.     Limit intake of caffeine-containing drinks as caffeine can increase dryness and irritation in\n              the throat.\n       c.     Do not smoke, avoid smoky environment, and do not drink alcohol. It also increases the\n              likelihood of heartburn, which can also damage the throat and vocal cords.\n       d.
