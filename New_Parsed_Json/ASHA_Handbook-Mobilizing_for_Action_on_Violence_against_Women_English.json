          "md": "Remember that violence against women is a manifestation of power. It is often individuals in positions of power who engage in inflicting abuse on women. There is a chance that because of your involvement in mobilizing against the issue and helping women who encounter violence, may make you vulnerable to harassment and even abuse by dominant, powerful individuals in the community. You should always be conscious of this and actively seek the support of other individuals such as the elders in your village and members of the VHSNC. Make sure that it is well known in the community that you have linkages and connections amongst respected elders, police and the health care system. Also practise safety measures such as avoiding walking alone, staying away from isolated places, moving in groups after dark, etc.",
