Hence, the focus should be on\n       counselling every family with a young child below one year of age, because\n       it is this time, especially in the age of 6 to 18 months that most children\n       become malnourished.\n\nRecognising Malnutrition\nIt is difficult to recognise malnutrition just by looking at a child. Only very\nsevere cases would show obvious signs of weakness or wasting by which time\nit is too late. Most children look normal but their height and weight when\nmeasured is less than expected for their age. It is therefore essential to weigh\nevery child monthly, so as to detect malnutrition in time. Depending on the\nweight the child can be classified as mild, moderate or servely underweight.\n\nSick children need special a�ention. However, families of all children especially\nchildren below two should be counselled on feeding the child so as to prevent\nmalnutrition.\n\nSix Important Messages for Preventing Child Malnutrition\n1.     Exclusive Breastfeeding: Till the age of six months, give only breast milk;\n       not even water should be added.\n\n2.     Complementary Feeding: At the age of six months, add other foods.\n       Breastfeeding alone is not enough, though it is good to continue\n       breastfeeding for at least one to two years more. There are five things to\n       remember about complementary feeding:\n       (i)  Consistency: Initially the food has to be so� and mashed. But later,\n            anything that adults eat can be given to the child, with less spices. Do\n            not dilute food. Keep it as thick as possible, for e.g. ‘give daal not daal\n            ka pani’.\n\n       (ii) Quantity: Gradually increase the amount of such foods. Till at about\n            one year, the child gets almost half as much nutrition as the mother.\n\n       (iii)Frequency: The amount of complementary foods given should be equal\n            to about half what the adult needs in terms of nutrients. But since the\n            child’s stomach is small, this amount has to be distributed into four to\n            five, even six feeds per day.\n\n       (iv) Density: The food also has to be energy dense, low in volume, high in\n            energy, therefore, add some oil or fats to the food. Family could add a\n            spoon of it to every roti/every meal. Whatever edible oil is available in\n            the house is sufficient.\n\n       (v) Variety: Add protective foods – green leafy vegetables. The rule is that the\n            greener it is, or the more red it is the more its protective quality. Similarly\n            meat, eggs, fish are liked by children and very nutritive and protective.\n\n3      Feeding during the illness: Give as much as the child will take; do not\n       reduce the quantity of food. A�er the illness, to catch up with growth, add\n       an extra-feed. Recurrent illness is a major cause of malnutrition.\n\n\n\n8 Simple Skills that Save Lives",

Though useful for everyone, it is of\n        particular importance to the malnourished child with recurrent diarrhoea.\n\n   (c)  Full immunisation of the child: Tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis and\n        measles are all prevented by immunisation and are the diseases that cause\n        severe malnutrition.

Some children are thin but do not have visible severe wasting. This assessment step helps you in identifying the children with visible severe wasting who need urgent treatment and **referral to a hospital**.\n\n- To look for visible severe wasting, remove the child’s clothes. Look for severe wasting of the muscles of the shoulders, arms, buttocks and legs. Look at the child from the side to see if the fat of the buttocks is missing. When wasting is extreme, there are many folds of skin on the buttocks and thigh.\n\n- The face of a child with visible severe wasting may still look normal. The child’s abdomen may be large or distended.\n\n- Look and feel to determine if the child has swelling of both feet. Use your thumb to press gently for a few seconds on the upper surface of each foot. The child has oedema if a dent remains in the child’s foot when you lift your thumb.\n\n### Determine Grade of Malnutrition\n\nThe AWW uses a growth monitoring chart for every child. Every child in the village should be weighed and his/her weight plotted on the growth chart. There is a separate chart for boys and for girls under the age of five years.\n\n**How to plot weight for age and identify malnutrition:**\n\n- The left hand vertical line is the measure of the child’s weight.\n\n- The bottom line of the chart shows the child’s age in months.\n\n",

These can occur in many illnesses. Some danger signs may occur without any relationship to the type of illness. For example fever, diarrhoea, pneumonia, meningitis or malaria can all produce lethargy or unconsciousness. These illnesses can also make the child so sick that the child is not able to drink any fluids. These are called **general danger signs**. The presence of even one general danger sign is enough to indicate a severe disease. A danger sign calls for immediate referral. Where signs of common illness like cold and cough, fever, and diarrhoea are present without any of the danger signs, and where there is no doctor, you could provide some home-based care to the child and keep a watch for signs that indicate the need for referral.\n\n### What are the questions to be asked when seeing a sick child?  \nEvery child who is seen for an illness should be checked for the presence of the following general danger signs:  \n* Not able to drink or breastfeed  \n* Vomits everything  \n* Has convulsions  \n* Is lethargic or unconscious.\n\n### How to assess a sick child for danger signs?  \n**Step 1: ASK: Is the child able to drink or breastfeed?**  \nA child has the sign “not able to drink or breastfeed” if the child is not able to suck or swallow when offered a drink or breast milk.

Management of Diarrhoeal Disease\n\nObjectives of the session\n\nBy the end of the session, the ASHA will learn about:\n\n•  Be able to diagnose dehydration and ascertain if referral is required.\n\n•  Learn the skill of preparing and demonstrating ORS use to the mother/caregiver.\n\n•  Learn the skill of counselling the mother for feeding during diarrhoeal episode.\n\n\n\nPrevention of Diarrhoea\nGood hygiene practices and use of safe drinking\nwater also protect against diarrhoea. Hands\nshould be thoroughly washed with soap and\nwater a�er defecating and a�er contact with\nfaeces, and before touching or preparing food or\nfeeding children.\n\nTo prevent diarrhoea, all faeces, including those\nof infants and young children, should be disposed of in a latrine or toilet or\nburied. If there is no toilet or latrine, adults and children should defecate\naway from houses, paths, water supplies and places where children play.\nFaeces should then be buried under a layer of soil. Human and animal faeces\nshould be kept away from water sources. In communities without toilets\nor latrines, the community should consider joining together to build such\nfacilities. Households can be encouraged to build their own toilet.\n\nStep 1: Identifying the nature of diarrhoea\n•  Duration: Ask the mother if her child has diarrhoea. Passing stools more\n   than three times a day is diarrhoea. Usually it is watery.\n\n•  If the mother says the child has diarrhoea: Ask for how long the child has\n   had diarrhoea. If the diarrhoea is of 14 days or more duration, the child has\n   severe persistent diarrhoea. This child should be referred to hospital.\n\n•  Passing Blood: Ask if there is blood in the stools. The child who is passing\n   blood in the stools has dysentery. This child also needs referral. But one\n   can start treatment at home also, especially if the access to a doctor is not\n   immediately possible. The child should be treated with Cotrimoxazole at\n   home (dosage as Annexure 6) and the mother should be advised home care.\n\nStep 2: Assess every child with diarrhoea for dehydration.\n•  Look at the child’s general condition. Is the child lethargic or unconscious?\n   Is the child restless and irritable?\n\n•  Look for sunken eyes.\n\n\n\n\n24 Simple Skills that Save Lives",

Reproductive Tract Infections (RTIs) and\nSexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)\n\nObjective of the session\n\nBy the end of the session, the ASHA will learn about:\n\n•  Understand RTI/STI and HIV/AIDS³; prevention, management and\n   treatment.\n\n•  Be able to counsel women on protection from RTI/STI and HIV/AIDS.\n\n•  Be able to guide women to appropriate facilities for testing and treatment.\n\n\nIs white discharge normal?\n•  Some amount of white discharge is normal. It is the vagina’s way of\n    cleansing itself.\n\n•  The amount of discharge varies during different phases of the menstrual\n    cycle. During the fertile period it is wet and slippery, and clear.\n\n•  During pregnancy, the discharge increases in amount.\n\n•  Discharge that is bad smelling (smell of menstrual blood, fishy odour),\n    white lumpy discharge (curd, coloured greenish, yellowish, reddish,\n    bloody), accompanied by itching, a rash, sores, burning urination, and\n    lower abdominal pain, pain during intercourse is indicative of RTI or STI.\n\n•  A change in colour and odour is an alert to the women of a possible\n    infection. In addition, if there is itching or burning, there is high\n    possibility of an infection.\n\n•  Discharge is also indicative of certain hormonal problems or even cancer.\n\nWhat are STIs?\nSTIs are infections that are passed from an infected person to another during\nsexual intercourse. Mothers can pass on STIs to babies during the delivery\nprocess.\n\nMost STIs are RTIs. However a few like Hepatitis-B and HIV are STIs but not\nRTIs. Many Reproductive Tract Infections are Sexually Transmi�ed Infections.\nHowever many other Reproductive Tract Infections are contracted by other\nmeans e.g. post childbirth or abortion or from GI infections.\n\nWhy are STIs serious problem for women?\n•  Because the infected semen stays longer inside a women’s body.\n\n•  The entire genital tract in women is hidden, therefore, the infection stays\n    inside for a longer time and is silent for longer.\n\n3This section has also been covered in Book 3. Thus, this session is expected to serve as a\nrefresher course.\n\n\n\n44 Simple Skills that Save Lives",

During the fertile period it is wet and slippery, and clear.\n* During pregnancy, the discharge increases in amount.\n* Discharge that is bad smelling (smell of menstrual blood, fishy odour), white lumpy discharge (curd, coloured greenish, yellowish, reddish, bloody), accompanied by itching, a rash, sores, burning urination, and lower abdominal pain, pain during intercourse is indicative of RTI or STI.\n* A change in colour and odour is an alert to the women of a possible infection. In addition, if there is itching or burning, there is high possibility of an infection.\n* Discharge is also indicative of certain hormonal problems or even cancer.\n\n## What are STIs?\n\nSTIs are infections that are passed from an infected person to another during sexual intercourse. Mothers can pass on STIs to babies during the delivery process.\n\nMost STIs are RTIs. However a few like Hepatitis-B and HIV are STIs but not RTIs. Many Reproductive Tract Infections are Sexually Transmitted Infections. However many other Reproductive Tract Infections are contracted by other means e.g. post childbirth or abortion or from GI infections.\n\n## Why are STIs serious problem for women?\n\n* Because the infected semen stays longer inside a women’s body.\n* The entire genital tract in women is hidden, therefore, the infection stays inside for a longer time and is silent for longer.\n\n----\n\n³ This section has also been covered in Book 3. Thus, this session is expected to serve as a refresher course.\n",

This is transmi�ed by the female anopheles mosquito. There are\ntwo types of malaria: Vivax and Falciparum. Vivax is not very dangerous but\nfalciparum malaria can cause damage to the brain, liver and lungs.\n\nHow does it spread?: When the mosquito bits an infected person, the parasite\nenters the mosquito’s stomach.
