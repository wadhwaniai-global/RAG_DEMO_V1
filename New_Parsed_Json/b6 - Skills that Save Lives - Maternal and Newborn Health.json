In order to make sure that all women have good iron\n             stores, all pregnant women should be given iron tablets, even if they are not\n             anaemic. Anaemia can be detected by a simple blood test, which measures\n             the amount of a pigment called Haemoglobin (Hb). Low levels of Hb mean\n             that the woman has anaemia (see box below). The test should be performed\n             during the antenatal check-up.

For the newborn, the recommendation is to visit on the\n    3rd day, 7th day, 14th day, 21st day and 28th day. A er this period,\n    visits are still needed once in two weeks till the child is two years\n    old for nutrition advice, immunisation advice, and support for\n    breastfeeding and complementary feeding, for illness prevention\n    and just to remain in touch.\n\n • In\n    eﬀ  ect therefore, you would need to visit on the 3rd, 7th, 14th day,\n    21st, and 28th day, and a er that, once every two weeks starting from\n    the 42nd day, till the child is two years old. If the child is born at\n    home, then of course you should be there at birth or at least visit her\n    within the ﬁrst hour.\n\n •  Advice to the mother during these visits:\n\n    ◆   Assess the mother for signs of complications (see below for the\n        list of complications) and ensure appropriate referral.\n\n    ◆   Encourage her to rest for at least six weeks a er childbirth.\n        Families should be counselled to allow this.\n\n    ◆   Encourage her to eat more food than usual. She can eat any kind\n        of food but high protein foods – pulses and legumes (nuts are\n        especially useful), foods of animal source. She should also drink\n        plenty of ﬂuids.\n\n\n\n\n3  Post-partum care has been covered in ASHA Module 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n38 Simple Skills that Save Lives",
